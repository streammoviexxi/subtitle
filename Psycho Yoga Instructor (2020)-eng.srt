2
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,582
Tom?

3
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,450
Mm...

4
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,585
You slept in
your office again.

5
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,253
Mm, late night.

6
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,658
There's been
a lot of those lately.

7
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:37,130
Well, we didn't have an office
in our old apartment, so...

8
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,499
I'm getting used
to the new digs.

9
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,137
Well, if I knew I was gonna
be sleeping alone so much,

10
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,007
I would've said we could
just stay in the apartment.

11
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,343
It's my job, Justine.

12
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,379
If you want us to be
a family of three...

13
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,282
Daddy's gotta make sure
there's a roof over our heads.

14
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,822
Are you worried?

15
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,824
No.

16
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,560
I am. I'm worried.

17
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,229
I'm worried that
the agency's gonna call

18
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,965
and say that we're not a match.

19
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,467
Look, any kid in the world

20
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,704
would be lucky
to have you as its mom.

21
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,305
It's gonna happen.

22
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,977
Can you do me a favor?

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,311
Sure.

24
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,182
Can you please try to keep the
referring to yourself

25
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,452
as "Daddy" thing to weekends
and in private?

26
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,587
Daddy cannot promise that.

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,026
Okay.
I'm gonna make us coffee,

28
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,328
take a shower,
go on my power walk.

29
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,464
- Great.
- Okay.

30
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,728
Tom?

31
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,230
Tom?

32
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,138
You are a married
middle school teacher.

33
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,606
You're, like, out
of the game forever.

34
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,775
Take it from someone
who's in the game year round.

35
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,544
Any time a man sleeps in
his office instead of at home

36
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,814
with his gorgeous wife,
it's 'cause he wants distance.

37
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,382
Is this another
one of your theories?

38
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,218
Stone cold truth, honey.

39
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,587
When they know they've
got you, they are boorish.

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,622
They sleep in their
offices or worse.

41
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,757
- Tom wouldn't.
- No, I didn't think Jeff would.

42
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,427
But when they're insecure,
there's a little competition,

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,295
that's when they
get their act together.

44
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,530
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

45
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,632
In your perfect world,
your husband,

46
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,534
the person that you've
chosen to spend your life with,

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,235
you just keep him
guessing forever.

48
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,004
- Ding.
- You're so crazy.

49
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,340
No, I'm just not gonna be
taken advantage of again.

50
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,774
Neither should you.

51
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,110
I'm so happy that we
moved ten minutes from you.

52
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,545
- Isn't that amazing?
- I know!

53
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,514
College brought us together.
Tom stole you away from me.

54
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,050
But then his work is bringing
us back together again.

55
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,619
That's meant to be.

56
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,721
Listen, you are stressing
out about the adoption.

57
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,458
You're sleeping alone
while your husband..."works."

58
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,360
You're gonna pop a
blood vessel if you don't relax.

59
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,896
And this whole speed-walking
thing is not cutting it.

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,431
- Ginnie, no.
- What?

61
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,699
I told you I don't like yoga.

62
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,569
One class! One class.
And if you hate it,

63
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,571
at least you get
to watch Dominic

64
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,373
and his abdominal muscles.

65
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,175
He's made up of those
and my fantasies.

66
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,410
You're so bad.

67
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,713
You need flexibility,
stability, and balance.

68
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:45,084
Why not go to the place where
you're gonna get all three?

69
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,987
Okay, I'll think about it.

70
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,989
- That's a yes.
- I said I'll think about it.

71
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,124
That's a yes.

72
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,725
You're a pain in my ass.
Go!

73
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,110
Are you okay?

74
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,715
No.

75
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,518
If they didn't
feel it was a match,

76
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,255
there's gotta be a reason.

77
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,560
It doesn't
make any sense.

78
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,663
I guarantee you, the reason
is not on our end.

79
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,235
How can you guarantee that?

80
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,837
If it's not us, what, is it

81
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,506
the baby's fault
that we're not a match?

82
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,508
No, I'm just saying that...

83
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,611
there's politics in everything.

84
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,716
How are you so
matter-of-fact about this?

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,320
Honey, I wanted this to
happen as much as you did.

86
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,957
Why are you speaking
in the past tense?

87
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,596
Just trying to be realistic.

88
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,036
I feel like maybe...

89
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,240
maybe we should just
give it a little more time

90
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,008
before we dive
right back in again.

91
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,976
I think that would be smart.

92
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,011
And I think it would be
good for both of us.

93
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,751
I'm going to bed.

94
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,299
What are you wearing?

95
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,136
Yoga.
I signed up last night.

96
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,405
You signed up for yoga?

97
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,940
Yeah.

98
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,143
I just feel like I have
to get out of my head.

99
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:30,349
Not everybody checks off their
emotions in boxes like you.

100
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,984
I don't do that.

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,754
Sorry. I just feel like

102
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,324
I have to process my feelings
a little bit different than you.

103
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,060
Well, you've always have
had to process your feelings,

104
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,995
so that makes sense.

105
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,466
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

106
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,735
I'll see you, uh,
when I get home.

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,713
I can't believe
this is the first time

108
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,615
you're ever doing yoga.

109
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,650
Well, I did a class
or two in college.

110
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,588
It just never connected with me.

111
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,623
Spiritualism, I guess.

112
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,959
- Mm.
- What?

113
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,494
Just wait until
you meet Dominic.

114
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,964
I would connect with
that man over waffle batter.

115
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,473
I was walking to class today.

116
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,042
And I noticed this...

117
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:35,848
little sprig of green pushing
its way out of the cement.

118
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:41,020
Now, I couldn't tell if it was
a flower, a plant, or a weed.

119
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,458
But I respected its persistence.

120
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,702
We all have a ceiling,
like that sprig.

121
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,605
And like that little sprig did,

122
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,643
we have to break through
to achieve our full potential.

123
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,812
For my new students,
this is your first step.

124
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,448
Today is your first step
in your growth

125
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,784
toward what you're meant to be.

126
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,786
Now, I only noticed that,

127
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,422
'cause that woman
in front of me,

128
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,526
she stepped aside
so not to step on it.

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,563
Let's come to
standing, please. Warm up.

130
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,932
Big inhale.

131
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,133
Rise.

132
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,802
Exhale and swan dive
into your forward fold.

133
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,973
Keep your knees bent, ease
your body into that stretch.

134
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,342
Beautiful.

135
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,276
Bravo.

136
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,614
Now, that woman was
exactly what you imagine.

137
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,117
One big hand on her cell phone.

138
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,220
Big inhale, hands to knees,
halfway lift.

139
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,289
Beautiful, long spine.

140
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,395
What's the lesson here?

141
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,831
Hmm?

142
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,400
That sprig was small.

143
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,104
It was insignificant,
it was in an inconvenient place

144
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:09,775
it probably had
no right to be in.

145
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,044
But it wasn't ashamed.

146
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,650
Exhale, drawing back
into your forward fold.

147
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,319
Could have been
just a weed, but...

148
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,690
she stepped aside.

149
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,861
The world wants you to
be exactly like that.

150
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,463
Small.

151
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,264
Insignificant.

152
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,367
Inconvenient.

153
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,801
Rise with a flat back.

154
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:41,307
Big inhale, exhale,
hands to heart.

155
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,309
Beautiful.

156
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,581
But if you stand tall,

157
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:54,520
if you are who you are
with no apology...

158
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,056
the world has to
reckon with you.

159
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,694
It will have to.

160
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,098
Hmm?

161
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,569
Let us begin.

162
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,540
♪ Om ♪

163
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,711
♪ Om ♪

164
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,250
This is warrior two.

165
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,452
This one hurts.

166
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,387
I know.

167
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,056
But it's supposed to hurt.

168
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,461
Legs are shaking.

169
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,064
Arms are aching.

170
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,999
I know.

171
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,936
But the key to this
pose is standing tall.

172
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,006
Grow through your heart.

173
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,477
I know, it's supposed to burn.

174
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,846
Welcome the pain.

175
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,514
Embrace the discomfort.

176
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,819
You are ascending.

177
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,260
But that's the thing
about we warriors.

178
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:13,632
We stand tall when it hurts--
especially when it hurts--

179
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,203
when it aches.

180
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,873
We stand tall,
like that little sprig.

181
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,078
Breathe.

182
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,857
Do you have my handset?

183
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,326
Yeah.

184
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,929
Uh, you know me.

185
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,498
I don't like to
say "I told you so."

186
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,699
- Oh.
- Fine, I love to say

187
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,400
"I told you so,"
and I told you so!

188
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,138
- Well, it was pretty amazing.
- He's pretty great!

189
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,039
That man, mm!

190
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,776
How are you feeling?

191
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,611
Um, I feel taller.

192
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,646
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,517
It's good to see you
looking so relaxed.

194
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,119
Thank you, Dominic.

195
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,288
Thank you, Dom.
- Okay, alright.

196
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,790
So, why haven't
you asked him out?

197
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,260
Mm. Nobody knows
what his deal is.

198
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,196
He moved to town,
like, eight months ago?

199
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,132
But other than that,
he's a total mystery.

200
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,935
Why does that
do it for me so much?

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,508
I'm sorry about the baby.

202
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,513
It'll get better.

203
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,948
You're the best.

204
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,220
Alright, I love you.
- I love you.

205
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,858
Back to life.

206
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,598
Be the sprig!

207
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,417
Hi.

208
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,086
Hi.

209
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,122
The meeting went longer.

210
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,961
And I had to make a
conference call from the car

211
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,263
on the way here, so...

212
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,167
Okay.

213
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,306
I'm sorry.
I should've called.

214
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,510
Yeah.

215
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,015
How was your, um...yoga?

216
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,054
Yoga class was
great, actually.

217
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,192
So it was worth it?

218
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,327
Well, I was able to get out
of my head and forget about

219
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,331
the adoption, so yeah,
I would say it was worth it.

220
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,468
Great.
I am happy to hear that.

221
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,238
I wanna try again, Tom.

222
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,245
Okay. I think we should,
uh, let the agency contact us,

223
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,281
because that's
just how it works.

224
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,949
I know.
I just don't wanna miss out

225
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,186
on a baby that might need us.

226
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,188
Well, I don't...want
that to happen either,

227
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,025
but there's a whole...process.

228
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,194
Okay, but there's a way
to help the process, right?

229
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,063
We can manipulate
the politics of it all.

230
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,966
I mean, isn't that
what you do at the firm?

231
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,969
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

232
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,238
I have two letters
written to the board.

233
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,206
I have a call
scheduled for Tuesday

234
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,643
to get us back
on the top of the list.

235
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,413
I'll see what I can do.

236
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,048
Will you?

237
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,853
What does that mean?

238
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,122
Do you even want this baby?

239
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,994
I'm just saying what
we're both thinking, out loud.

240
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,131
Do you really think...

241
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,067
that I don't want us
to have a baby?

242
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,703
Do you really think that?

243
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:15,808
Then help me. Please.

244
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,613
Thank you for dinner.

245
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,556
I have a deadline, and
I'm gonna be in my office.

246
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,536
I am the sprig.

247
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,210
Sorry.

248
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,781
Is there no class this morning?

249
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,117
On Thursdays it's 11:00AM.

250
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,152
You're just a little early.

251
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,820
Oh, okay.
I'll leave. I'm sorry.

252
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,121
I don't wanna disrupt you.

253
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,324
No, no, please, please.
Come.

254
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:57,436
Um...yesterday's class
was, um, pretty great.

255
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,737
Well, it couldn't have
been all that great

256
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,906
if you're not too sore
for another class today.

257
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,778
That was a joke.
I'm joking.

258
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,880
Of course I'm joking.

259
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,949
You're welcome here as
much as you like, Justine.

260
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,651
Oh, you remember my name.

261
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,153
Of course.
You're one of my students.

262
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,788
Wow. It takes me,
like, two weeks

263
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,057
to remember my students' names.

264
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,527
A fellow instructor.
Meant to be.

265
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,465
May I ask you something?
- Sure.

266
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,234
This isn't exercise for you.

267
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,803
You're looking for
something...more.

268
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,740
There's a weight on you

269
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:39,044
and you're trying
to find a way to lift it.

270
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:44,716
Wow.
Yes, that's...exactly it.

271
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,552
I could feel it.

272
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,290
When you're ready, come and
see me for private instruction.

273
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,427
Uh, private instruction
like a trainer?

274
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,662
Trainers are for housewives

275
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,332
who are looking
for something...else.

276
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,635
I'm talking about a deeper path.

277
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,970
When you're ready.

278
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,174
What's up, sensei?

279
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,758
Hi.

280
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,794
You're trying
to give me a heart attack?

281
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:34,333
I...felt bad about
last night and how it went

282
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:39,204
and I just...wanted to come
home early and apologize.

283
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,007
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,809
They're beautiful, Tom.

285
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,911
Thank you.

286
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,646
You're welcome.

287
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,986
So is this a...

288
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,054
This yoga thing,
is it a routine?

289
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,858
- Yeah, maybe.
- Okay.

290
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,594
I like that you found something
that you're doing that,

291
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,064
you know, you enjoy
during your time off, so...

292
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,400
Thank you.

293
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,770
Was, um...was Ginnie there?

294
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,904
Why?

295
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,040
No, I'm just curious.

296
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:19,645
Oh, yeah, well, she was.

297
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,979
Okay.

298
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,382
Um...I'm gonna go change.

299
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,417
Okay.

300
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,919
And again, I'm sorry.

301
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,821
- Tom?
- Yeah?

302
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,792
- Never mind.
- No, what?

303
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,128
What were you gonna say?

304
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,729
It's fine.

305
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,970
Is this the life you imagined?

306
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,476
Is this not the life
that you imagined?

307
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,612
It's just, we were so young.

308
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,282
And we've been each
other's universe forever.

309
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,818
Okay, now I'm confused.

310
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,525
Since your promotion...

311
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,460
you've been distant.

312
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,496
I've been working.
Nonstop.

313
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,032
I'm giving this job
everything that I have.

314
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,401
Yeah, I know. I know.

315
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,604
It's just that I'm
putting everything in us,

316
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,841
and I really need you to
step up in that department.

317
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,081
Okay.

318
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,784
We'll just, uh...be the happiest
couple in the homeless shelter.

319
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,186
Fine.

320
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:38,390
I don't
wanna be homeless.

321
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,625
I just...

322
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,061
We've wanted a family
since we were dating.

323
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,129
I know.

324
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,733
And this is what we have
to do for our situation.

325
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,502
- You mean my situation.
- No, I did not say that.

326
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:55,207
I would never say that.
- But it's what you're thinking.

327
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,409
Okay.

328
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,844
Tell me I'm wrong.

329
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,681
Tell me I'm wrong that
you don't want a baby

330
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:07,085
and that you're happy our
application wasn't approved.

331
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,902
Savasana.

332
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,671
The corpse pose.

333
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,575
This one is the
hardest pose to master.

334
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,045
But it's also the perfect pose.

335
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,850
It's about stillness of body,
stillness of mind.

336
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:45,690
In the constant
chaos and movement,

337
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,995
keep stillness in your body.

338
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,330
Accept who you are.

339
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,367
It's not about being perfect.

340
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,571
It's about being present...

341
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,273
to this moment.

342
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,247
Two classes in a day?

343
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,783
Been a rough day.

344
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,485
I'm sorry.

345
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,988
Keep still and breathe.

346
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,276
When you're ready,
come to a seated position.

347
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,116
Thank you for sharing
your practice with me.

348
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,151
Namaste.

349
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,721
Namaste.

350
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,959
Since coming here, I mean,

351
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,196
my stress chakras were,
like, Everest.

352
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,300
And now, like, K2.

353
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,769
What brings you to the dojo?

354
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,371
I'm actually kind
of new at yoga.

355
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,874
I haven't done--
- Justine?

356
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,609
Hi.

357
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,645
I-- I was just
talking to Justine.

358
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,617
- I was ready to close up soon.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,552
I was just gonna ask
you a quick question.

360
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,053
Of course.

361
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,561
I'm gonna go.

362
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,129
To be continued.

363
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,532
Okay.

364
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,901
See you on the ground.

365
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,802
You know, I didn't know
that you were gonna close up.

366
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,638
We can talk about
this another time.

367
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,807
A little bit of free advice:

368
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,444
be careful.
- With that guy?

369
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:50,148
There are men who can
sense vulnerability.

370
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,517
I seem vulnerable to you?

371
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,453
It's a strength.
It's not a weakness.

372
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,924
But it can be exploited.

373
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,960
You wanted to talk about,
uh, private instruction?

374
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,562
Uh, yeah.
How did you know

375
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,031
that that's what
I was gonna ask you about?

376
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,732
Hopeful, I guess.

377
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:14,539
Um...I just wanted to
find out how it would work.

378
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,275
I see a lot of
potential in you.

379
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,249
We can work here after class
or at your home, if you prefer.

380
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,317
My home?

381
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,019
I mean, home lessons are
primarily for students

382
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,755
who want to transition
into teaching.

383
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,591
Into teaching yoga?

384
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,359
I thought that
was obvious, no?

385
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,627
No.

386
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,164
What makes you think I would
be a good yoga teacher?

387
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,100
This. You.

388
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,569
That same vulnerability.

389
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,237
It's a gift.

390
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,473
You're so open,
people can relate to you.

391
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:52,277
They...they wanna be near you.

392
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,246
I saw that the moment
you walked into my class.

393
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,319
You can make people become a
better version of themselves.

394
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,357
And we're gonna do exactly that.

395
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,159
I would love to try.

396
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:13,331
Um...would you just plug in a
few dates in my shared calendar?

397
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,402
Your husband, I assume?

398
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,371
Yes, Tom. He works.

399
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,905
That's a good
quality in a man.

400
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,274
Yeah, yeah. He works.

401
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,076
A lot.

402
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,379
Just easier if we're
on the same schedule.

403
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,048
Four or five days a week?

404
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,651
Well, yeah, Dominic
thinks I could be a teacher.

405
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,554
Oh, you wanna teach yoga now.

406
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,556
Well, I don't know.
I-- I really like it.

407
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,692
And...who knows?

408
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,727
Could bring in some extra money.

409
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,629
You know, I was thinking
during the school year,

410
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,431
I can work weekends,
and during the summer,

411
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,867
I could do it full time.

412
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,902
You wanna be a
full-time yoga teacher?

413
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,204
Well, I just thought if I
bring in some extra money,

414
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,673
then you wouldn't
have to work so hard.

415
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,742
You don't
think I can handle it.

416
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,711
No, I-- I know
that you can handle it.

417
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,914
I just...I wanna see you more.

418
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,817
Well, do you think five days
a week of Yoga Seminar 101

419
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,852
is a good way to
accomplish that goal?

420
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:12,390
I need this, Tom.

421
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:17,262
You know, when we get
a baby-- and we will--

422
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,797
it's gonna be a long road.

423
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,699
And...yoga strengthens me,

424
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:26,271
and it balances me.

425
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,074
I'm a sprig.

426
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,543
You're a what?

427
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,813
It's...a term
I learned in yoga.

428
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,252
Well, if this is
something that you need,

429
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,354
then...I'm on board.

430
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,763
Do you, um...

431
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,099
wanna sleep in our bed tonight?

432
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,002
I would love to
sleep in our bed tonight,

433
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,704
but I have the McConnell
meeting in the morning,

434
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:02,307
and I need to be prepared.

435
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,376
Okay. Good night.

436
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,445
Good night.

437
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,543
Just a second.

438
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,046
There you go.

439
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,617
It is not illegal to smile.

440
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,990
The sprig,
home edition begins.

441
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,059
Dominic, hi!
Please come in.

442
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,330
This is my house.

443
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,031
Ah.

444
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,700
You've got a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

445
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,769
Can I offer you
a smoothie, water?

446
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,104
Oh, no, I'm good.

447
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,540
Oh, this is Tom's office.

448
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,146
He works for a law firm,
so when he brings work home,

449
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,015
this is where he winds up.

450
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,618
- Is that often?
- Ah, here and there.

451
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,054
Lies.

452
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,623
Huh?
White lies are toxic.

453
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,758
- Oh, I'm not--
- That's okay.

454
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,127
I'm not criticizing.
I used to lie all the time.

455
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,263
I'm just saying that
I'm here to work on your health

456
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,566
and to maintain that health.

457
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,770
But to do that, we have
to remove the toxins.

458
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,172
Yeah?
- Okay.

459
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,774
- Love the office, by the way.
- Yeah.

460
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,510
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

461
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,444
Oh, my God.

462
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,747
Really?

463
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,815
Yeah.

464
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,183
Look at you two.

465
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,052
I know, we were
just kids back then.

466
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,788
- The whole world ahead of you.
- Mm.

467
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,423
No idea what's coming.

468
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,926
You wanna go outside
and do some yoga, hmm?

469
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,027
Yeah.

470
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,796
You might wanna
put a lighter outfit.

471
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,333
It's a hot one.
- Oh, okay.

472
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,678
Push.

473
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,313
Excellent.

474
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,049
Bring your knees together...

475
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,952
and hold it.

476
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,621
Awesome.

477
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,458
Push back.

478
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,295
Exhale towards me.

479
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,567
Yes. More.

480
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,102
That's it.

481
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,173
Hold it for ten.

482
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,309
You're invincible.

483
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,311
Five...

484
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,846
four...

485
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,482
three...

486
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,118
two...

487
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,487
excellent.

488
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,855
Well done!

489
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,457
You're gonna have
my job in no time.

490
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,424
Yes, you will!

491
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,661
I think so.

492
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,235
Huh.
I came home early.

493
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,671
I thought we could
have some lunch.

494
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,340
- Oh, this is my yoga--
- Hey!

495
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,313
You must be Tom.

496
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,148
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

497
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,122
Justine is a perfect student.

498
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,257
Yes, she's...
always really good

499
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,994
at anything she puts
her mind to.

500
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,196
And body.

501
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:36,601
Okay, I'm gonna...

502
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,971
I'm gonna let you guys
get back to what you were...

503
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,539
whatever that was.

504
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,310
Thank you.

505
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,586
Come on,
let's do this!

506
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,961
Breathe in.

507
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,032
Right leg goes back.

508
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,202
Seal, on the floor.

509
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,905
Okay.
- Okay.

510
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,841
You gotta really firm up, see?

511
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,593
Bend your front knee.

512
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,530
Tilt forward, and raise
your right leg up.

513
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,832
Oh, I don't know about that.

514
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,367
Come on, you can do it.

515
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,941
That's it.

516
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,442
Hold it.

517
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,979
I'm doing it.

518
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,314
Straighten your back.

519
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,485
And...relax.

520
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,455
See? That's my girl.

521
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,090
Bravo!

522
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,592
Huh?

523
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,693
Big breath in.

524
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,696
Exhale.

525
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,267
Sit down into your chair pose.

526
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:20,037
Keep your palms
closer to your heart.

527
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,206
Open your shoulders.

528
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,442
That's it.

529
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,277
Tuck your tailbone in.

530
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,115
Why did you come to me?

531
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,151
Ginnie just raved about you.

532
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,688
But why now?

533
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,123
Just worked out.

534
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,729
Don't lie to me.

535
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,867
Toxins.

536
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,706
Um...we're trying
to adopt a baby.

537
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,076
It's been stressful.

538
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,616
Arms reach up, parallel.

539
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,817
Lift 'em up.

540
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,389
Breathe.

541
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,028
You're gonna be a great mom.

542
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,963
I can see that.

543
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,531
I'm sure Tom does, too.

544
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,472
Um, is this the whole thing?

545
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,310
Imagine there is
a weight between your hands,

546
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,312
you're holding it up.

547
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,916
At the same time,
push down on your heels.

548
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,685
Breathe.

549
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,856
That's it.

550
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,124
Breathe.

551
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,068
Thanks for the lift!

552
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,039
Whew.

553
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,112
Tom?

554
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,980
No.

555
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,749
Where have you been?

556
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:17,722
I was at a yacht
regatta in the south of France.

557
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:25,529
Or, I was down at
Kincaid's drinking.

558
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,165
It was the second one.

559
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,601
We need to talk about today.

560
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,169
Okay.

561
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,872
Right now?
- Yeah.

562
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,007
Okay.

563
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,963
Why are you acting like this?

564
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,932
- Dominic.
- What are you looking for?

565
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,635
- Don't worry about it.
- You know what?

566
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,071
You could've been
nicer to him today.

567
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,439
Oh, I could've been nicer?

568
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,274
So we're gonna
make this about me?

569
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,642
This is all my fault?

570
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,713
Well, you ran off and you
got drunk like a teenager.

571
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,015
Well, I'd like
to see a teenager afford

572
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,483
what I was drinking tonight.

573
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,019
Okay, Tom, I am
trying to be serious.

574
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,121
I'm being serious.

575
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,224
All of a sudden, you wanna spend
all your time with some yoga guy

576
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,727
because now yoga's your thing.

577
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,596
And then I come here,
and he's here.

578
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,465
And then you're dressed like...

579
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,735
some cougar on the prowl?
- Excuse me?

580
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,737
And I'm supposed to
be an adult about it?

581
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,942
Okay. I'm feeling like--

582
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:49,446
"I'm feeling"?
Ugh.

583
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,450
Please don't use that
therapy crap on me, okay?

584
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,652
The reason
why we went to therapy

585
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,420
is so that we could
communicate better.

586
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,356
I know. It was...great.

587
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,626
I'm glad we did it.
It was money well spent.

588
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,095
I don't wanna argue with you.

589
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,864
I don't wanna argue either.

590
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:10,367
I just want our house
to be a calm and serene place

591
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,369
where we both feel safe.

592
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,538
We need that.

593
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,341
Our baby will need that.

594
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,212
Tom!

595
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,809
Tom, um, I waited here
for you as long as I could.

596
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,346
But...I really don't know
if we should move forward

597
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,214
without your wife knowing.

598
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,385
Give me a call when
you can on my cell.

599
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,896
Okay. Okay.

600
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,166
I came as soon as
I got your message.

601
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,769
Hmm.

602
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:26,971
When you're suffering,

603
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,707
it is important to
look at something fabulous.

604
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,044
I'm so sorry, honey.

605
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,781
You know, the ironic part is
the reason why he was drunk

606
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,118
on the couch like some
heartbroken frat boy

607
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,887
is because he was jealous.
Of Dominic!

608
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,357
I mean, it doesn't
even make sense.

609
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,624
That makes perfect sense.

610
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,692
If he's off
with someone else,

611
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,127
what does he care
what I'm doing?

612
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,963
Because he thinks that you're
the one doing the cheating.

613
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,934
That takes precedence over
anything that he's doing.

614
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,336
You know, he was
gone this morning.

615
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,437
He didn't say a thing to me.

616
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,307
He didn't want to apologize
or say, "Let's talk."

617
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,241
He's humiliated.

618
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,609
That's what men do
when they're humiliated.

619
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,011
They shut off.

620
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,483
You know...

621
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,618
I didn't even notice.

622
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,987
What?

623
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,624
The moment that
my life fell apart.

624
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:25,195
Your life is wonderful.
You are great.

625
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:30,100
This is just one of those
moments that has its challenges.

626
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,273
Working with Dominic has given
you all the tools to help you

627
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:40,678
face everything that
life's thrown at you, yeah?

628
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,813
Yeah.

629
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,315
So dive in.

630
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,087
Nails.
Oh, thank you.

631
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,166
And hold it for three breaths.

632
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,268
Two...

633
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,236
one.

634
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,472
One more.

635
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,475
And relax.

636
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,243
Lay on your back.

637
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,280
Savasana.

638
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,152
Everything okay?
- I'm fine.

639
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,156
Toxins.

640
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,627
Everything is not fine.

641
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,663
He is not happy.

642
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,934
And we're going down a slope.
I don't know what's at the end.

643
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,704
I'm not interested in
the "he" or the "we."

644
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,240
I'm interested in you.

645
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,509
That's why you're here:

646
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,077
to work on you.

647
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,248
To strengthen your body,
your soul, and your mind.

648
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:54,818
But it's not just about me.
It's about Tom too.

649
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,921
Justine, everything
is about you.

650
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,323
It starts from yourself.

651
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:04,061
You have to love yourself first
before you love others.

652
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,729
Tom is just a distraction.

653
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,398
He's not...

654
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,067
your solution.

655
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,540
Would you like to know
what your solution is?

656
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,509
Yes.

657
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:23,013
Working on yourself. With me.

658
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,783
I just feel like
I'm trying to fix something

659
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,185
that's been broken for years.

660
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,221
That's fine.
We all have pasts.

661
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,823
As long as they
remain in the past,

662
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,759
our futures are
ripe for the taking.

663
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,097
I just feel lost and alone.

664
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,866
No, no, no, no,
you're not alone.

665
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,568
I'm here.

666
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,270
Relax.

667
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,808
Relax your shoulders.

668
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,511
Drop your jaw.

669
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,713
Relax your face.

670
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,048
Breathe.

671
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,718
Sigh it out.

672
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,422
Bravo. Again, breathe.

673
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,298
What's the
anchor of your past?

674
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,700
His work.

675
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,404
He sleeps in the office.

676
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:24,341
Our marriage and our
hope for a family is...

677
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,910
in the background.

678
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,047
That's the past.

679
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,716
You are here now.

680
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,718
Focus on now.

681
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,290
Come here. It's okay.
It's okay.

682
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,722
Oh. I'm sorry.

683
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,590
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.

684
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,693
I should go.

685
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,732
Please, don't let this
stop you from continuing.

686
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,601
Your potential is amazing.

687
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,770
Dominic.

688
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,240
I...

689
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,210
lied.

690
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,178
What?

691
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,348
I'm not sorry for the kiss.

692
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,751
I...

693
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,053
I don't know what to say.

694
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,455
Just...ask me to stay.

695
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,494
I need time to think.

696
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,864
I have something for you.

697
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,672
It's an
amethyst crystal cluster.

698
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:07,678
It's a healing stone for
balance, peace, and protection.

699
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,546
- Protection?
- For you.

700
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,248
For the toxins in your life.

701
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:17,921
A little bit of
protection never hurt anyone.

702
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,790
I'm so-- I can't.
I can't accept this.

703
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,391
It's already yours.

704
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,030
Take it.

705
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,235
Thank you.

706
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,577
Are you okay?

707
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,079
Yes.

708
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,781
Mm.

709
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,086
Who's S?

710
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,093
S?

711
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,363
In your phone, Tom.
Who is S?

712
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,998
Wait a minute, you--

713
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,667
you went through my phone?

714
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,282
Alright, apparently
Mother Nature has decided

715
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:02,085
she doesn't like my
midnight Saturday classes

716
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,620
any more than you do.

717
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,592
Reach up. Hold it.
Beautiful.

718
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,961
Open up your heart.

719
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,429
Hold it.

720
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,099
Hold it up.

721
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,834
Beautiful.

722
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,236
Reach.

723
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,871
No expectations here.

724
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,239
No judgment.

725
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,107
Just breathe.

726
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,711
Exhale, hands to heart.

727
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:28,979
Beautiful.

728
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,249
Listen to your body.

729
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,417
Really listen.

730
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,821
It's important that
you listen to your body.

731
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:42,559
Your mind's gonna...cloud
the message your body's sending,

732
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:48,532
filling you with memories of
the past and thoughts of others.

733
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,336
Elijah!

734
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,211
I can't believe you
went through my phone.

735
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,213
You still haven't
answered my question.

736
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,482
I don't feel like I should.

737
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,584
After 16 years of
marriage, Justine,

738
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,220
you'd figure that I would've
earned a little bit of trust.

739
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,189
I heard her voicemail, Tom!

740
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,090
So you can't just
pretend it's a coworker.

741
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,962
I know what this is.

742
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,198
Oh, yeah, what?

743
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,067
It's the yoga guy.

744
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,535
Yeah, maybe
you've done something.

745
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,837
Maybe you're, I don't know,
thinking of doing something.

746
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,641
But that doesn't mean that I am!

747
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,644
Don't try to turn
this around on me.

748
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,880
You still haven't
answered my question.

749
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,649
You know what?
You can find out for yourself.

750
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,919
Here.
- It's 1:00AM.

751
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,822
Nobody's gonna pick up.
- She'll answer. Call.

752
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,060
We're in the
middle of a class.

753
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,728
Don't you dare!

754
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,229
I have no idea
what you're talk--

755
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,497
Hey, hey! Hey, relax.

756
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,633
I have no idea who Elijah is.

757
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,202
Don't you dare
do that me, Elijah!

758
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,004
He's you!

759
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,974
Just say that he's you!
He's you!

760
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,141
Hey, relax, relax.

761
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,543
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

762
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,079
You told me you wanted me.

763
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:12,349
You told me you needed me.

764
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,886
I left my husband for you!

765
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,022
My kids!

766
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:24,427
Is this what gets you off?

767
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,765
Stealing women, forcing them to
throw away their lives for you?

768
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,935
It took me
two years to find you!

769
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,903
Maybe you have confused
me with somebody else.

770
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,538
Ma'am, my name is Dominic.

771
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,943
You weren't Elijah either,
or Jay in San Francisco,

772
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,979
or Terrance when you spent
that summer in Portland.

773
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:49,185
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I tracked
you down, Sebastian Nikos!

774
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,354
You cost me my last cent.

775
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,824
But you already took everything
else away that mattered!

776
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,526
I understand you're
very troubled, Miss,

777
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,928
but I'm not the man
you're looking for, okay?

778
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,997
Now you can leave.

779
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,872
Please leave.

780
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,677
Or I'm gonna have
to call the police.

781
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,045
Ow.

782
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:26,489
He's not the
man you think he is.

783
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,795
Go.

784
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,663
Out!

785
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,820
This is
Dr. Stephanie Sullivan

786
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,022
at the Finding Forever
Adoption Agency.

787
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,957
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you

788
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,927
as soon as possible.

789
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,533
I'm also working the
politics, like you said.

790
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,672
And I found another agency.

791
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,843
And I might have possibly
found another baby.

792
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,167
You were trying to
find us another baby.

793
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,905
Why didn't you tell me?

794
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,045
'Cause I was afraid
I was gonna lose you.

795
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,450
But I also didn't want you to
have to go through that again

796
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,118
if I wasn't for sure.

797
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:11,161
You didn't have
to do that alone.

798
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,862
I was trying to protect you.

799
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:22,172
I'm trying, Justine.

800
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,140
I'm trying.

801
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,361
Jeff, I know it's late.

802
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,832
Early, whatever,
I don't-- I need a favor.

803
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,069
Did I give you the beach house?

804
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,971
Then you owe me.

805
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,040
Does your friend still work
for the police department?

806
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,043
Okay.

807
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:03,179
I need you to give him a
name to look up for me.

808
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,617
Sebastian Nikos.

809
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,653
Also goes by Dominic Romero.

810
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,057
Thank you.

811
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,233
I miss having you here.

812
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,269
I'm home all the time.

813
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:03,139
No, I mean, here.

814
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,843
You know what?
When I get back,

815
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,379
I'm gonna take a few days off.

816
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:13,049
I feel like we need
a little us time.

817
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,717
Back?

818
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,121
Okay, we really need to
start looking at each other's

819
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,456
shared calendars
because I go to Dallas.

820
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,991
I leave today.

821
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,993
I have that
litigator's conference.

822
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,131
Do you have to go?

823
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,266
I know that you hate it
when I ask you that.

824
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,267
I just...

825
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,071
There's something that
we need to talk about.

826
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,007
Yeah, I have to go.

827
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,145
But it's the last trip
for a long time, okay?

828
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,616
Okay.

829
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:51,287
What do you wanna talk about?

830
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,426
Nothing.

831
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,828
It can wait until you get home.

832
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,109
I'm done with the pills.

833
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,110
What?

834
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,715
I'll stop 'em.

835
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,783
I'm done with them.

836
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,589
Good.

837
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:28,925
I just-- I know that
you knew about it.

838
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,193
I just...

839
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:35,098
I just don't want
you to worry about it, okay?

840
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,642
I think that...

841
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,210
if we're gonna start
to focus on the baby,

842
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:52,882
I should put all of
the yoga stuff on hold.

843
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,218
You don't wanna teach anymore?

844
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,122
Maybe one day.

845
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,391
But...

846
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:06,696
right now, I just want you...

847
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,098
and a baby to love.

848
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,303
Let's hit rewind, okay?

849
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,838
Deal.

850
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,578
I canceled the
session for today.

851
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,180
New start.

852
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,252
New start.

853
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:34,290
I love you so much.
- I love you too.

854
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,214
Tom!

855
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,316
Dominic.

856
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,485
We have a session at 10:00.

857
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,687
Oh, she told me
she canceled it.

858
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,023
Really?

859
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,292
I didn't get a
message or anything.

860
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,597
Going somewhere?

861
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,366
- A business trip.
- Another one?

862
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,336
Yes.

863
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,905
I have two types of students:

864
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,475
the ones who come to me
to escape their schedules

865
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:26,776
and the ones who come to me

866
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,446
to escape those who live
and die by their schedules.

867
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,181
That's great.

868
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,785
Well, I should, uh, be going.

869
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:40,123
So...she'll be in touch.

870
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,325
How about you?

871
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,660
What about me?

872
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,796
Justine tells me
how much you work.

873
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:50,066
How...often you're gone.

874
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,667
- She does?
- Yeah, she tells me about

875
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,037
all the toxins in your life.

876
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,873
It must be draining
for your body and soul

877
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,275
to harbor such weight.

878
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,479
I feel pretty good.

879
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,681
Really?

880
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,151
Really.

881
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,819
A session with me
is what you need.

882
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,421
- Oh, no, no. No.
- Yeah! Why-- why not?

883
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,389
It's just...

884
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,958
Come on, I gave your
wife what she needed.

885
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,436
She'll be in touch.

886
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,274
Okay. Tell Justine
I'll see her soon.

887
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,650
What happened?

888
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,261
Thank God you're here.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

889
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:02,031
This crazy, obsessed
woman stormed into the studio.

890
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,432
- What?
- Yeah. I don't know.

891
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,035
She was confused.
She thought I was somebody else.

892
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,371
Somebody who broke her heart.

893
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,139
Poor thing.

894
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,676
But now that you're here,
everything seems right again.

895
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,413
Dominic?

896
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,483
Dominic? Dominic?

897
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,084
What is it?

898
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,756
Look, all of this
has been amazing.

899
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,224
It has.

900
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:33,296
And you and I, in another
timeline, who knows?

901
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:38,234
But I canceled
today's session because...

902
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,936
I think we need to
stop all of this.

903
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,172
The yoga, everything.

904
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,940
- Stop it?
- Yeah.

905
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,978
I-- I really need to
focus on my family.

906
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,112
Tom and I--

907
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,948
Don't mention the past.

908
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,085
He's not the past.
He's my husband.

909
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,522
Where was he when
we were on the grass...

910
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,389
in each other's arms?

911
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,124
He sure felt like
he was the past.

912
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,327
Okay, I made a mistake.

913
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,862
And it's my fault,
and I'm really sorry.

914
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,664
It wasn't your fault.

915
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,133
It was his. It's his.

916
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,669
He drove you
right into my studio.

917
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,904
He made you go through hell.

918
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,873
A real man, a man who really
loves you, would never do that.

919
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,875
A real man would
take care of you.

920
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,277
He does!

921
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,248
A real man would
always be there for you.

922
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,852
A real man would never
make you feel alone.

923
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,655
He would make you feel safe.

924
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,691
I don't think you should
talk to me like that.

925
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,593
Huh.

926
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,996
I have every right to
talk to you like that.

927
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,599
Every right.

928
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,271
- I love you.
- Don't say that.

929
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:53,142
Why not? It's true.

930
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,145
If you search inside, if you
really search inside of you,

931
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,581
you would see
that you love me too.

932
01:06:58,614 --> 01:06:59,782
- Dominic--
- I know.

933
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:03,152
I know it's scary.

934
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:07,456
But would the sprig
let fear rule its life?

935
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,058
Dominic.

936
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,026
I don't love you.

937
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,028
I don't really know you.

938
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,731
And you don't love me.

939
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,334
It's over.

940
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,369
You're breaking my heart.

941
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,278
You are stabbing
a knife in my heart.

942
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,521
And I am scaring you?

943
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,256
Hmm?

944
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,462
That was too much.
I'm so sorry.

945
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,064
The toxins are
playing once again.

946
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,101
But you take all the
time you need, okay?

947
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,837
Sorry, that was too much.

948
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,639
You take all the time you need.

949
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:13,823
All the time you need.
Relax, up.

950
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,565
Breathe.

951
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,333
Lift your heart up.

952
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,939
Take all the time you need.

953
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,441
Breathe.

954
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,377
Exhale.

955
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,880
All the time you need.

956
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:56,031
His original
name is Sebastian Nikos.

957
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,974
That's his first wife, Paula.

958
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,009
He served three years for that.

959
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,452
Poor thing.

960
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,588
Then he starts moving around,
changing his name.

961
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,559
He's got a type.
They're all married.

962
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:27,162
It seems his MO is he gets
what he wants, then he bolts.

963
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,864
He's very persuasive.

964
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,201
What is this?

965
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,169
The last girl,
13 months ago.

966
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:37,039
She hanged herself.

967
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,341
But...look what
her husband said.

968
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,443
"She was scared
to death of heights."

969
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:45,214
There's no way that she climbed
to the top of that tower.

970
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,951
You don't think--

971
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,419
Portland PD did.

972
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:53,989
They just couldn't find
any evidence to prove it.

973
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,091
Do you think that he's going
after these women because

974
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,927
he's trying to get back
at them for something?

975
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,765
Here's what I think.

976
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,067
I am not gonna waste
any time trying to figure out

977
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,069
this level of crazy.

978
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,237
I'm gonna go file
a police report.

979
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,573
Come with me.
- I kissed him.

980
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,311
Oh, God.

981
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,580
It was in the moment.
It was fast. But I--

982
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,951
You should not be alone.

983
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,419
It'll be okay, right?

984
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,788
You're gonna pack a bag, come
with me to the police station,

985
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,524
and stay with me tonight.

986
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,626
Okay.

987
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,095
Thank you for being
such a good friend.

988
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,130
Try fabulous.

989
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,699
Meet me outside.

990
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,649
- Delayed? How long?
- Just a few hours.

991
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:57,553
Just a few hours, and you're
not ranting and screaming

992
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,024
and going on a Twitter tirade
against the airline gods?

993
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,392
I'm sorry, where's my husband?

994
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,827
Can you put him back
on the phone?

995
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,430
Okay,
fine, I deserved that.

996
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,166
Oh, I'm in too good a mood.

997
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,168
It's nice to feel
close to you again.

998
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,838
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

999
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,774
No, I mean,
I really miss you.

1000
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,578
This house feels creepy
when you're not here.

1001
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,180
Creepy?
Is everything okay?

1002
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,249
Yeah.

1003
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:29,952
Just...being silly.

1004
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,454
Um, I'll-- I'll call
you from Dallas, okay?

1005
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,324
I love you.
- I love you too.

1006
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:13,395
It's me, it's me. It's okay.

1007
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,935
Please don't scream.
Please don't scream.

1008
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,481
Come on, already.

1009
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,784
Ginnie, um...

1010
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:39,054
I...um...

1011
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,790
I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna come with you.

1012
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:45,027
Look, it's one night
without your bed.

1013
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,396
You'll get over it and
thank me before you know it.

1014
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,700
No, I'm gonna be fine.
I'll-- I'll see you tomorrow.

1015
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,202
You sure?

1016
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,504
Uh-huh.

1017
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,439
- Okay, then.
- Mm-mm.

1018
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,075
I love you.
I'm calling you in the morning.

1019
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,556
That went great!

1020
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,992
Beautiful!
It was amazing!

1021
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,694
What do you want from me?

1022
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,264
Your partnership.

1023
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,433
A negotiation to start over.

1024
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,438
Sure.

1025
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,840
Don't lie to me!

1026
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:46,054
Do you love him?

1027
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,858
He's my husband.

1028
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,796
Husband.

1029
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:00,269
Husband?!

1030
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,337
A man who's never there for you?

1031
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,507
A man who-- who doesn't
sleep with you?

1032
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,178
Who-- who-- who would rather
sleep on his couch

1033
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:12,014
rather than next to you?

1034
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,816
To your body?

1035
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,153
A man who won't
give you a child?

1036
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,159
Or can't give you a child?

1037
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,698
Do you love a man like that?

1038
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:38,106
No.

1039
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,722
You love him.

1040
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,359
You're damn right I do.

1041
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,274
My grandmother had this chair.

1042
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,010
Not this.

1043
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,612
But, like-- it was like this.

1044
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,515
I'm sorry about before.

1045
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:36,084
The toxins were overwhelming.

1046
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:41,823
But it was necessary
for us to...start over.

1047
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,825
What did you do?

1048
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,927
Nothing. Nothing.

1049
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,097
I'm not a monster, Justine.

1050
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:52,634
I would never
touch you before...

1051
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,770
before knowing one thing.

1052
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:02,177
Did you sleep with him
after our moment together?

1053
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,249
That's none of your business.

1054
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:14,289
His body's polluted!

1055
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,425
And now yours is too.

1056
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,464
How could you do that?

1057
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:27,402
How could you undo all
the work I did on you?

1058
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,007
Why?

1059
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,227
Get in the tub.

1060
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,062
You're insane.

1061
01:18:57,799 --> 01:18:59,000
Insane?

1062
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,504
You know what insane is?

1063
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,741
Insane is thinking
you're special...

1064
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,244
when you're just
another minivan mom

1065
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,779
crawling into my studio,

1066
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,547
thinking that
she can reset her life.

1067
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:18,653
Insane?

1068
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,489
I have feelings for you.

1069
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,124
I really do.

1070
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,294
If only you could trust me.

1071
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:29,131
I did trust you.
I came to you for help!

1072
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,066
Shh!

1073
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,335
Get in the tub.

1074
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:39,040
Get in the tub. Get in the tub.

1075
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,219
You never needed my help.

1076
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:56,725
You just wanted to ascend to a
life that wasn't yours to take

1077
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,660
the easy way.

1078
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,262
I've chosen others.

1079
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,666
If you've chosen others,
why don't you leave me alone?!

1080
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:08,336
Because...

1081
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,508
...you're the last.

1082
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,876
- Are you calm, huh?
- Yes.

1083
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,444
- Are you calm?
- Yes.

1084
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,479
Yes.

1085
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,587
Justine, I'm not stupid.

1086
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,989
- Yes.
- I'm not stupid, Justine.

1087
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,358
I know you're not stupid.
I'm not stupid either.

1088
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,096
I'm a sprig.

1089
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,600
I'm a sprig.
I'm a sprig.

1090
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:33,121
A little protection
never hurt anyone.

1091
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:16,665
No! No! No!

1092
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,867
- Stop!
- No!

1093
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:20,568
It's me!

1094
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:21,937
What's going on?

1095
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,973
Are you okay?

1096
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,441
What's going on?
What--

1097
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,307
Tom.

1098
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,164
You too.

1099
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,829
You okay?

1100
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:05,607
Tom.

1101
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,210
I kissed him.

1102
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,184
Nothing else happened.

1103
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,186
I stopped it.

1104
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,755
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1105
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,926
So sorry.

1106
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,861
This is all my fault.

1107
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:34,135
And I love you so much.

1108
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,638
Please forgive me.

1109
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,610
I'm so happy you're home.

1110
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,450
Why did you come home?

1111
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:56,691
I also have
something to tell you.

1112
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,169
Hey, Tom,
it's Stephanie.

1113
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,438
I have some great news!

1114
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,373
There's a baby, one week old.

1115
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,108
And the agency feels
like you and Justine

1116
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,911
would be the perfect match
for this little girl.

1117
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,547
Give me a call back and
let's get you all together.

1118
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,746
I was, uh,

1119
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,549
walking to class today.

1120
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,152
And I noticed this
little sprig of green

1121
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:01,990
pushing its way
out of the cement.

1122
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:08,329
Now, I couldn't tell if it was
a flower, a plant, or a weed.

1123
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,900
But I respected its persistence.

1124
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:24,078
For my new students,

1125
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:28,516
today is your first step
in your growth

1126
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,685
toward what you're meant to be.

1127
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,224
Let us begin.

1128
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:43,424
