﻿1
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,540
Selamat malam.

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,134
Ini adalah Thomas Williams di
V1 Studios dengan berita terbaru.

3
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,445
Di seluruh dunia
telah ada laporan

4
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,315
tentang getaran kecil
dan pemadaman listrik

5
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,609
semua berpusat dari
satu titik asal di London.

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,454
Kami sekarang pergi ke
afiliasi kami di lapangan

7
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,118
di London untuk
mencari tahu lebih lanjut.

8
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,258
Terima kasih, Thomas.

9
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,360
Kami sekarang berada di luar arena,
di mana suasananya sangat sepi

10
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,797
dibandingkan dengan kekacauan yang
dilaporkan hanya beberapa jam sebelumnya.

11
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,632
Kami telah menerima
ratusan laporan

12
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,567
tentang kilatan
lampu neon di langit

13
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,338
hanya beberapa saat setelah
pemadaman listrik terjadi di seluruh kota.

14
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,440
Para pemimpin tidak memberikan jawaban

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,809
Tetapi jelas masalah berpusat di sini,

16
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,178
di mana militer
sekarang memfokuskan

17
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,237
upaya mereka untuk
melakukan penyelidikan.

18
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,174
Kami akan terus melaporkan
keadaan terkini.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,815
Bersiaplah.

20
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,474
Kami mendekat.

21
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,764
Ya Tuhan.

22
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,603
Tim pusat, kami telah
menemukan sumber energi.

23
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,572
Apakah kamu merasakannya?

24
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,374
Ya

25
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,579
Murphy, pimpinlah.
Kami akan mengawasi.

26
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,347
Dimengerti.

27
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,858
Saya belum pernah melihat
EMF dan tingkat radiasi setinggi ini.

28
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,430
Inframerah dan
gerakan juga meningkat.

29
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,146
Tim pusat, kami
telah mencapai target.

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,413
Izin untuk melanjutkan?

31
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:55,708
Izin diberikan.
Lanjutkan dengan hati hati.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,510
Dimengerti.

33
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,679
Ayo.

34
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,619
Melihat sesuatu?

35
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,623
Tidak.
Dingin sekali di sini.

36
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,793
Kami melihat
pergerakan di arah jam 12.

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,275
Murphy, jangan sentuh itu.

38
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,910
Ini luar biasa.

39
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,945
Itu adalah perintah

40
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,506
Ini...
hanya permainan arcade.

41
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,742
Siapa yang punya koin?

42
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,236
Ada yang aneh

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,338
Apa yang terjadi?
Apakah kamu mendengar ini?

44
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,606
Pegang dia

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,875
Apakah kalian mendengar ini?
Murphy!

46
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,578
Suara... Suara... Oh!

47
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,013
Suara! Ini semakin keras!

48
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,273
Murphy?

49
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,444
Tolong aku!

50
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,283
Apa-apaan ini?

51
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,288
Begitu banyak orang.

dibohongi dan

pembohong, dan kekuatan asing
yang ingin kita lihat dan percayai.

881
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:10,534

buta mengklik 'Terima'

mereka... terlalu sering.

kepada penawar tertinggi,

banyak omong kosong yang tidak kita

butuhkan, membuat kita marah pada

891
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:41,990

martabat dan privasi manusia?

892
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,211

893
01:27:45,235 --> 01:27:47,671
ke dunia kecil kami yang tenang.

894
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:48,997
Tapi tidak.

895
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:53,611
Tidak, mereka harus
menyerang pikiran kita.

896
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:58,406
Mereka ingin mengontrol dan
memanipulasi seluruh realitas.

897
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:02,377
Tapi saya harus bertanya-tanya,
siapakah "mereka" itu?

898
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,780
Apakah masih ada "mereka" lagi?

899
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:12,029
Mungkin algoritme dan AI
telah menjadi "mereka" baru, dan

900
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:15,399
mungkin sekarang mereka
mengontrol dan memanipulasi kita.

901
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,801
Nah, mereka mengenal kita lebih baik
daripada kita mengenal diri kita sendiri.

902
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:20,404
Kami-kami-kami harus sadar.

903
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,473
Saatnya sadar!

904
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:25,442
Sadar, semuanya! Sadarlah!

905
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,846
Jangan hanya duduk di sana menonton!
Lakukan sesuatu!

906
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:33,684
Ini adalah kesempatan terakhir kita untuk
mengambil kembali kendali

907
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,843
Sebelum terlambat.
