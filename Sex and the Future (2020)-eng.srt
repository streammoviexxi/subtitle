Next.

2
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,781
Hey I'm uh Evan Kleinman reading
for the role of Jose Perez.

3
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,287
Oh...

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,454
Cristina I, uh...

5
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:51,961
I really like you and I've
been waiting to do this for

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,898
some time...

7
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,307
Well, the kiss?

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,975
Go.

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,178
Just kiss her, come on.

10
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:13,215
Um...

11
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,783
Go

12
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:18,187
Kiss her, come on.

13
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:21,790
Okay uh, thank you.

14
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,625
Can I just go
out and come back in?

15
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,560
No.
That's not gonna work. Nah I'm sorry,

16
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:28,998
We're not gonna call you, it's
not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

17
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,133
Yeah, that wasn't good.

18
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,559
You made out
with someone who had herpes?

19
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:02,164
Hahahaha! You loser!

20
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,733
Has this happened to you?

21
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,701
Actually sir can
you just drop me off right here

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,637
on this corner. Yeah, thank you.

23
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:13,175
Yeah you know what
sir I'm actually gonna get out too.

24
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,580
What kind of car do you drive?

25
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,883
This is not
suitable for Gluber pool.

26
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,219
It says here your
drop off is in the valley.

27
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:27,856
I'm just gonna
walk up Laurel Canyon drive.

28
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,027
Just please
give me five stars. Please?

29
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey dad.

30
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:39,435
What's up, son?

31
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,070
Uh, I just
got out of an audition.

32
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,406
Actually, yeah, I think
I'm gonna get a callback.

33
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,474
What's the pay?

34
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:46,876
Copy, credit, meal...

35
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,511
Listen! It's not good enough.

36
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,047
We've been through this a
million times! I'm an actor!

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,283
Why don't you come back
home and work with your old man?

38
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,684
Mom and I cannot
see you struggling like that.

39
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,290
I love you. I gotta go.
Okay? Oh, one last thing!

40
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,026
Can you wire me some money?

41
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,661
I have a couple
bills I need to take care of.

42
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,899
Listen and listen
good! This is the last time.

43
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:12,034
Of course, of course Dad.

44
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:15,237
Thank you so much. I love you.

45
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:21,444
Hey guys! Evan here. I
just got out of an audition and

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,315
it went amazing! I'll keep
you guys posted if I got it.

47
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,783
Evan out!

48
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,633
Oh, about time!

49
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,171
Hello Evan.

50
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,177
VR mode starting.

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,145
My God...

52
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,350
Oh Evan...

53
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:38,653
I'm so horny.

54
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,729
Before we start making
out, do you wanna dance?

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,999
I'd love to.

56
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,427
Let me make you happy.

57
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,095
Yes.

58
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:49,558
The country of
Allur was founded in 1894

59
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:51,327
by two hot people.

60
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,230
No one is certain of its
exact geographical location

61
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:57,399
but many speculate
it is in the Middle East.

62
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:01,203
The kingdom of Allur was
in such financial crisis that

63
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:05,840
the royal guards had
to wear Halloween costumes.

64
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,679
The kingdom of Allur.
A naturally beautiful country.

65
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,549
From its scenic
views and flowing rivers

66
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,484
to its gorgeous natives.

67
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:18,887
Our land will transport
you to a world rich with romance

68
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:23,025
and passion all
provided by Zuku Zuku.

69
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:27,096
For decades Allur has been
the leader in the sacred art

70
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,934
of love making. Not even the
Kama Sutra knows of such lust.

71
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:37,772
Allur, the land of Zuku Zuku.
Travel packages now available.

72
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:42,244
Cut!

73
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:50,519
This is what we do?
This is shit! This is purely shit!

74
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:56,258
Calm down!
Imagining a big lollypop!

75
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,259
Lollypop?

76
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:58,227
Lollypop!

77
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,361
Did you guys like it?

78
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,663
I loved it! it's great!

79
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,666
Yes it is fantastic work!

80
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,634
But we are going
with the other plan.

81
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,270
You know the Zuku Zuku
doesn't work well anymore anyways.

82
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,606
All these western hipsters
care about these days is

83
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,741
quick bang bang sploosh!

84
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,013
Your royal highness,
Prince Ahmed and Prince Ali!

85
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,949
Mommy.

86
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,052
Father.

87
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:28,691
Khalid, Khalid!
You made sure my third son is

88
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,159
occupied
during this meeting?

89
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:33,362
Oh yes your majesty,
nothing to worry about.

90
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,971
Darwin Coming!

91
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:48,177
Darwin you are so
brave, why don't I just untie you

92
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,179
and we go back to bed?

93
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:54,316
If we ever get out of this,
that villain is going to pay!

94
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,388
Oh Mister Darwin!
You are so handsome!

95
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,192
Oh ok, tea time!

96
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:06,328
Just come lay with me!

97
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:09,531
Our time for today is
over. I have a family meeting.

98
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:10,532
I gotta go!

99
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,067
Where's the mirror?

100
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,471
There are no mirrors
here. Let me tell you my story.

101
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:20,075
Once upon a time I
was born, like I am now, I was

102
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,544
incredibly handsome...

103
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,749
It must never leave the palace

104
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,420
What is this? This is dangerous.

105
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,888
Is it a baby?

106
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:37,760
In fact a witch decreed that if
I ever saw myself in the mirror

107
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,428
I would turn ugly.

108
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,230
We made this?

109
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,365
That's why
there are no mirrors here.

110
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:46,735
How unlucky it is that
you'll never be able to witness

111
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,170
your own beauty?

112
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,573
And what is more
important than being handsome?

113
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:53,108
Nothing my prince.

114
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,810
The prince must go now.

115
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:56,979
It has been decided. We will
complete a two billion dollar

116
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,281
deal with hip new
energy out in California.

117
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,651
Prince Ali and Prince Ahmed will
leave tomorrow to seal the deal

118
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:05,254
and deliver the
bags of money to Los Angeles.

119
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,989
Why don't you wire the money?

120
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,625
Because they want to charge
me a thirty dollar wiring fee!

121
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,126
What a rip off!

122
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,496
Sons, this is our last
resort to save the country.

123
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,334
I trust you to take
care of this. Good day.

124
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,805
The royal
Highnesses, Prince Fahad!

125
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,607
What is this father? I'm
hearing about Los Angeles.

126
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,877
I have been asking years
to send me to Hollywood.

127
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,013
I'm sending your brothers
Ali and Ahmed to California

128
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,081
to invest
in new forms of energy.

129
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:35,885
Energy is our
business after all.

130
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:38,353
I have been
wasting my talents here.

131
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,823
Your only talent is
having sex and watching

132
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,559
that stupid
Darwin action movie!

133
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:44,626
Darwin action films!

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,627
Silence!

135
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:46,995
Please father.

136
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,465
Enough! You're
forbidden to leave this palace.

137
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:52,434
The world is full of mirrors
Fahad, and you know what

138
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,169
happens when
you look into one.

139
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,438
I know what's gonna
happen. I will become ugly

140
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,307
and I will be sent
to live with the cows.

141
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,311
Exactly, you have no self
control. You can't be trusted.

142
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,480
This is for your own safety.

143
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:06,916
We are simply trying
to protect you, Fahad.

144
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,819
Protect me from what my
mom? I'm wasting my time here.

145
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,524
Meeting adjourned!

146
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,462
Khalid! Khalid!

147
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,333
Yes, your majesty.

148
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,335
I have an important job for you.

149
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,036
Right hand man
kind of important?

150
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,339
I need you to
keep Prince Fahad safe.

151
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:33,208
Of course your majesty,
that has always been my job.

152
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,345
You understand
he's always been different.

153
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:39,949
It is true. The Prince marches
to the beat of his own drum.

154
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:42,518
He's damned ugly!

155
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,820
Oh yes, that.

156
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:47,756
Don't let him ruin the
opportunity to save the country.

157
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,291
I will not fail you my king.

158
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,693
Of course you won't.
Otherwise you will be hung.

159
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,562
Wait, I thought we
don't do that anymore!

160
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,865
You're right. We
will cut off your testicles.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,767
Both of them?

162
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:00,569
Both of them!

163
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,620
Oh my god...

164
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,093
Oh! What?

165
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,932
What is that?

166
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,732
Oh you found the new prototype.

167
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,702
Yeah, I'm testing out
this new hydrocarbon silicone

168
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,470
polymer composite.

169
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,473
Wait, so it's a
head that gives head?

170
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:39,841
That's the idea.

171
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,443
Is this a sex toy?

172
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,611
Mhm.

173
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,746
Dude you can
make a full robot of her.

174
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:48,083
I would so love that. I mean,
just imagine. You and me, we'll

175
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,419
be able to get with the most
beautiful women in the world

176
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,622
even if we look like
bridge trolls, which we don't

177
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,756
by the way.

178
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,825
And the sex will be real.

179
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,928
It's sex and the future!

180
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:03,699
So this is your plan? Your plan
to finally lose your virginity.

181
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:06,435
Nice work
buddy. I'm proud of you.

182
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:09,973
But it's
complicated. I'm low on funds.

183
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,976
So how was last night with that
chick from your acting class?

184
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,643
Am I good or am I good?

185
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,447
Ah man, the file, it skipped
a little bit, but otherwise

186
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,050
incredible.
Barry you're a genius.

187
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:24,519
Just wait once I figure out this
sex-bot thing. All I need is

188
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,155
one pathetic rich guy who's
willing to cough over some

189
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,491
major mulah...

190
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,761
Ah!

191
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:58,955
You poisoned them?

192
00:12:59,088 --> 00:12:59,956
They are asleep.

193
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:01,356
You took my Xanax.

194
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,492
Khalid we must go, quickly.

195
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,160
But I have to
speak to your father

196
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:06,528
and brothers
before their flight.

197
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,263
They are not going. We are.

198
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:09,498
No we cannot!

199
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,000
Khalid.

200
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,502
The jet is ready for take off. I
am going, either you are going

201
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:16,039
with me or you will be hung.

202
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:42,831
Follow your partner.

203
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,769
Watch them. Connect.

204
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:51,941
Feel the flow.

205
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,078
This is the best acting class.

206
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,781
You should be honored
that I share my time with you.

207
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,486
Stephanie and Evan focus!

208
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:09,725
You haven't paid me
for this class or the last one.

209
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:14,663
Yeah about that. My
dad's going to pay, tomorrow?

210
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:15,764
Your father?

211
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,433
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Soon, very soon.

212
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,403
Daddy's gonna pay it soon!

213
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:26,241
Back when I was doing
a production of 11th Night...

214
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:27,944
I wish I was a millionaire.

215
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,979
Can you imagine
yourself as a millionaire?

216
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,847
You'd be cocky and unbearable.

217
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,816
Yeah I know I would
and I'd like to try it anyway.

218
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:39,287
Switch partners.
Rachel you're with Evan.

219
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,158
Stephanie you are with Aaron.

220
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:48,663
And everyone on their feet.
Come on. Let's go. Breathing.

221
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,867
Very important. Breathing.

222
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,973
Harrumph!

223
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,640
Evan?

224
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,411
Evan? What is this?

225
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,714
Did I ask you to do this?
What is this?

226
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:10,019
This is not part of the
breathing exercise. Ready?

227
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:11,954
Ready, yeah.

228
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,828
Where did you
pick up that bad habit?

229
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,030
Um..

230
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,631
Yo, that teacher's a dick.

231
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:24,666
Yeah he made you cry dude.

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,638
I'm over it. Yo Throw
rooftop tonight? All the celebrities are

233
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:32,641
gonna be there.
Rachel's gonna come with us.

234
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:33,675
Sweet.

235
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,377
Oh yeah, I've been there.

236
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,712
Is there
something going on tonight?

237
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:40,950
Depends,
how many followers do you have?

238
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,453
Um.. like 20...

239
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,357
20,000 isn't enough.

240
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,859
Bro, you need 100,000.

241
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,561
Oh.

242
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:55,664
I got 110. She's got
300. She's blowing up.

243
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,633
Yeah, Let's ditch this loser.

244
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:12,681
She's cute.

245
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,783
That's my mom.

246
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,752
At least you
know your followers are real.

247
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,388
Ten of them are bots, actually.

248
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,028
I better go, bro. See ya...

249
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:43,712
Who
the hell are these guys?

250
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:48,017
Woo! Lets go lets go!
Fast Fast.

251
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,753
We don't have
time. Yeah this one.

252
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:57,759
Okay! Okay!
I'm going. Okay!

253
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:06,701
Let's go! We are here!
Woohoo! Go fast!

254
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,472
What brings you to LA?

255
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,741
We are here to
begin my acting career.

256
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:16,145
No way, that's interesting.
Actually...

257
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,914
I do a little acting myself.

258
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:23,019
That's interesting. Do you
know Darwin? The action star.

259
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:26,755
Um, no, no.
Can't say that I do.

260
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,024
Haven't had the pleasure yet.

261
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:29,058
Fahad!

262
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:30,558
Khalid! We are in America!

263
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:33,963
Do not call me
Fahad. Call me Darwin.

264
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,299
So mister actor driver.

265
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,732
It's Evan.

266
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:42,038
Yes Evan, you
are an actor and an Uber driver?

267
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,872
Yeah, yeah that's right.

268
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,042
Have you been in
anything we might have seen?

269
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:47,842
No. No.

270
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:51,981
I'm still trying
to get thing on track.

271
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:55,784
But I do take classes down at
Tantrum Acting Studios though.

272
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:58,453
Thats amazing.
Khalid write this down.

273
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,455
Write it down. We're
gonna go to this class.

274
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:01,456
Fahad.

275
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,959
Darwin. Darwin. Darwin.

276
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:06,128
Darwin, we must prioritize,
first securing the

277
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,931
investment before we
enroll you in any classes.

278
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:12,667
What's this investment
you guys are talking about?

279
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,539
Tech. So what
is hot out here in LA?

280
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:20,443
The women.
That's the hottest thing.

281
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,112
Oh and vegan cheese.

282
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,414
What? That's disgusting.

283
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,350
Ew.

284
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,094
Wow, wow
this is just the beginning!

285
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:44,166
Thank you so much Mr. Actor Evan
Driver. Here you go.

286
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,371
Thank you. Oh I'm
so sorry if I offended you.

287
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,906
Please take this as well!

288
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:53,909
Thank you.

289
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:54,910
Thank you.

290
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:57,046
Thank you.

291
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:00,049
Fahad!

292
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,297
Woohoo!

293
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,066
Wow!

294
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,069
Darwin!! Woohoo!!!

295
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:24,073
Yeah. Yeah. Freeze!

296
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,708
It is I Darwin!

297
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:42,391
Okay, alright. Alright. Yes.

298
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:47,163
Oh it feels so good.

299
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:56,539
Where did it go? It's
gone, they'll chop my head off!

300
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,207
Fahad!

301
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,112
Fahad! Where are you? Fahad!
There was another bag like this,

302
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,113
did you see it?

303
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,448
What?

304
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,782
There was another
bag like this, did you see it?

305
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,286
I only remember bringing one.

306
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:19,161
Fahad, where is that bag?

307
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:21,130
Fahad that bag
had a lot of money in it.

308
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,566
The money your brothers were
going to use to secure that deal

309
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:26,235
they had in place. The deal
that would have saved our

310
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,471
country and
bought us time out here!

311
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,741
What's going on there?
Why am I looking at the sky?

312
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,643
Your majesty, it's
so good to see you again.

313
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,514
You promised me quick returns
on my energy investment deal.

314
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,350
Why is hip new energy
calling me about the money?

315
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,553
Uh, your majesty it's very early
morning out here and people in

316
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,188
LA go hiking.

317
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:50,459
All you had to do was hand them
the money and sign the papers!

318
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,898
You hung up on the king?

319
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:00,102
You hung up on the King?

320
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:02,972
You hung up on-
You Hung up on the King!

321
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:05,608
Relax Khalid. Everything will
be fine. We're going to do the

322
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,844
investment and I will be a movie
star. Someone will find the

323
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,647
money and bring it
back. I am sure about that.

324
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:31,534
A suitcase,
let's see if there's some dirty panties.

325
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,339
The actor driver!

326
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,801
This is it?

327
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,905
Yes this is the acting school.

328
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,213
Your headshot needs to say
everything about you in one

329
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:22,750
quick glance. It needs to say
you're young but old at the same

330
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,755
time. You're elegant,
yet you're mean.

331
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,060
You're mean, yet educated.

332
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:34,096
Sneaky, but educated.

333
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,132
But mentally ill!
Very important!

334
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:41,070
Wait outside, wait outside!

335
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,642
Excuse me.

336
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:48,711
My client
wants to take your class but he

337
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:50,246
does not like mirrors.

338
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:54,383
Listen pal this is the
world's greatest acting class

339
00:22:54,516 --> 00:22:57,953
taught by the world's
greatest acting teacher.

340
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,023
You think you can just waltz...

341
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,294
Carry on!

342
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,462
You wait right here.

343
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:11,000
Headshots. Evan, your headshot?

344
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:16,705
Mr. Evan actor driver sir did we
happen to leave a bag of money

345
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:18,007
in your car?

346
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,644
Uh I
don't think so, no. I'm sorry.

347
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,879
Who is your agent?

348
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:27,116
Oh, you mean
FBI agent? I don't think so.

349
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:28,484
How'd you find him?

350
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,119
Oh, my father hired him.

351
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:31,253
Who's your friend?

352
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:33,455
Oh I'll
introduce you, come on.

353
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,724
Hey! I'm Steph.

354
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:36,925
Hi, nice to meet you.

355
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,460
Nice to meet you too.

356
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:41,930
Wow. Wow. Woo.

357
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:45,833
Hi, my name
is Darwin. You can call me

358
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:49,738
D-R-O-O-N-S-N-Y-O

359
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,141
Okay, Hi Darwin.

360
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:55,144
Okay party people
back to the headshots!

361
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:56,745
Come Fahad we must go!

362
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,681
Darwin! Call me Darwin!

363
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,149
Darwin we
must go find the money!

364
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:01,684
I'm not going
anywhere, you can go.

365
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:05,454
You did pay for it. I'm
gonna take this class. Just go.

366
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,590
Did you bring a headshot?

367
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:09,892
What does that mean?

368
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:11,694
A headshot.
A picture of yourself

369
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,462
Oh, no.

370
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:29,378
So remember keep
working on your scenes privately

371
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:34,216
with your partners an as a
special bonus I have a casting

372
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,585
director from a major major

373
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:39,388
major studio coming to
see your final presentations.

374
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:46,195
And one last
thing. My new all organic vegan

375
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:48,797
gluten free diet has become
very expensive, so effective

376
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:54,169
immediately the prices for
these classes has gone up 60%.

377
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:58,774
Beat it! Get out of here.

378
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:03,545
And Evan this might be
a good time to call daddy.

379
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:09,218
And Fahad great
work! I'm very impressed!

380
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:10,819
Is Khalid coming back?

381
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:11,820
I don't think so.

382
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,622
Okay.

383
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,426
I've learned so
much already today and scene!

384
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,495
Woohoo! I love it!

385
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:22,231
Well Tommy is the
greatest actor of all time

386
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,899
as he constantly reminds us.

387
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,701
We're doomed!

388
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,570
Oh, wow, this guys looks
like he needs a drink.

389
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:29,705
Yeah

390
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:30,939
I agree with you.

391
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,107
You guys
wanna go to my place?

392
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,709
Yeah let's go.

393
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:35,411
Cool. Follow me.

394
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,795
Barry! We have company!

395
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,663
Come on in.

396
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,935
Oh.
Hello hello!

397
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:01,637
Ugh, Barry.

398
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,472
How are you?

399
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:08,477
You look awfully
familiar. Have we met?

400
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,778
Oh no no no.

401
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,480
It's not who you
think it is. No it's not her.

402
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,282
You're the
chick from the VR machine!

403
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:16,285
No, no, that's not her!
Barry just let that one go.

404
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:17,887
Just be quiet.
Rachel, Steph.

405
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,955
Do you guys mind giving me
a few minutes you guys can

406
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,290
wait in my room. Thank you!

407
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:22,758
Evan,
I'm like 99.9 percent sure.

408
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:24,493
It's not her. Let it go.

409
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,864
Jeez Evan.

410
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:36,171
Oh my God. You
think he likes himself?

411
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,409
He's so pretty.

412
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:43,545
What is this?

413
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,049
It's like VR.
It's like a video game.

414
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,658
Dude you got her to move.

415
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,660
Yeah, she even talks.

416
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:01,096
Are you the
head that gives head?

417
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,866
I certainly am.
Would you like a blowjob now?

418
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,668
Yeah, so I solved all the
complexities and just built her.

419
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:07,669
What do you think?

420
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:08,871
Spectacular.

421
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,606
Would you like a blowjob now?

422
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:15,377
Yes, I want one. It's been two
days without any romance. Wow!

423
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,347
I think she's
my soulmate. I'm in love!

424
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,681
Come on man. Don't be stupid.

425
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:22,784
You can't
fall in love with a robot.

426
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:30,425
Oh, Evan I'm
so glad you're here.

427
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,494
Oh my God!

428
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,430
I'm so horny.

429
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,533
What?

430
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,237
Oh my. Oh my. Oh my god.

431
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,373
How much will you
need for full body prototypes?

432
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,542
Oh, I'll take over from here.
No, I got this. I got this.

433
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:50,579
Um as the spokesperson
for, uh, Evan Advanced

434
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:54,383
Robotics Corporation. We'll need
a minimum investment of ten

435
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:58,687
million dollars for a single
prototype and a retainer fee for

436
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,088
further production.

437
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,590
I have an idea.
I'm going to call the king.

438
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,391
Deal!

439
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,927
Beautiful. Thank you!

440
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,060
What is this?

441
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,395
No, Rachel, take that off!

442
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,631
Hey turn it off,
turn it off! Is it off?

443
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:14,003
It's for acting class
I'm a method actor.

444
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,671
What?

445
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:18,840
It's not real. Just go back to
my room. Back to my room.

446
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,076
I knew it was her!

447
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,981
Can you believe they
made me park my boat on the

448
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:29,886
other side of the port? I had to
walk 30 meters to my golf cart.

449
00:28:30,652 --> 00:28:33,188
Tell me about it,
my son just spent a fortune on

450
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:37,693
sex robots. Can
you believe that? Sex robots.

451
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,161
Sex robots?

452
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:40,862
I am truly embarrassed.

453
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:43,967
I have been very interested in
artificial intelligence for some

454
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,803
time now. The implications.

455
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,373
They are sending me a prototype.

456
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,580
Can you tell
your son to send two. Twenty!

457
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:07,556
Khalid had found a way to save

458
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:10,893
his ass from
losing that briefcase.

459
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,798
Well, well wow. Wow!

460
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:19,334
Barry! Barry!

461
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,802
What are you working on buddy?

462
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:25,340
Just this new
prototype. Hi everyone.

463
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,342
This place is...

464
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,012
Where stars are born!

465
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,855
Everything's okay!

466
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:42,491
This is very
unprofessional in my opinion.

467
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:46,662
Don't use the jacket. We
paid good money for that!

468
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,197
Khalid, should we run?

469
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,699
You run. I stay.

470
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:54,202
I'm running.

471
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:52,260
Welcome to Evanbots! This is the
assembly room where every part

472
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,197
is hand assembled.

473
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,833
First here at our nail painting
station is my buddy Barry.

474
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,703
After assembly
every part then moves on to

475
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:05,975
rigorous testing for movement.
This here is my buddy Dale,

476
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:10,079
our handshake specialist
manning the hand job.

477
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:13,116
Thank you sir. Up next

478
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,518
we go to our breast augmentation
station. We have over 1500

479
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:21,157
different types of boobs for
your choosing. How are you sir?

480
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,925
You're doing great pal.

481
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:25,460
Now I'd like for you to follow
me to quality control.

482
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,528
Come this way.

483
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:28,797
This is a private testing area.

484
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:32,467
I've got 10
more of these to test today!

485
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,370
You get the
idea. Quality control.

486
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:39,775
At Evanbots, we love
you and our robots do too.

487
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:43,146
Here at Evanbots
even you can get laid.

488
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,615
At Evanbots
satisfaction guaranteed.

489
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,085
The customer comes first.

490
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:54,157
Women aren't robots.
They're not sex toys.

491
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,491
They're
thinking, feeling people.

492
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,827
Don't you see the
damage this does to people?

493
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,062
They are just dolls.

494
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,497
With perfect
bodies, willing to do anything

495
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,201
they're
programmed by a man to do.

496
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,402
I see
what you're saying.

497
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,105
Do you?

498
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:12,909
Barry how smart
is the artificial intelligence

499
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,643
of these robot women.

500
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:17,280
Pretty smart, I
programmed them so they learn at

501
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:21,650
a high level. The idea is they
evolve and the sexual experience

502
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:23,652
are new and
more satisfying every time.

503
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:27,422
Wow, that's amazing! High five.

504
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:30,592
Alright see you. Wow.

505
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:33,095
Sex sound.

506
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:39,868
Fahad waited like
a creep until everyone left

507
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,336
the factory that night.

508
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:46,541
Well, well, well.
Woo! Wow. I love that.

509
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,911
WOO! Hoo, Hoo. Bark, Bark!

510
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:51,546
Time to put the final
ingredient together.

511
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,548
Ladies and gentlemen.

512
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:57,652
Haha there are no
gentlemen. Ladies,

513
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:01,023
You are going
to my home the kingdom of Allur.

514
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:05,261
You might be aware of our
tradition of zuku zuku. Zuku

515
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:10,599
zuku is more than love. Zuku
zuku is more than romance.

516
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:13,668
Zuku zuku is more than sex.

517
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:17,539
1,000 orgasms working as one.

518
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:19,175
Zuku Zuku!

519
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:20,910
Zuku Zuku!

520
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,212
Wow, Zuku Zuku.

521
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:24,412
Zuku Zuku!

522
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,883
Lets do it!

523
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,792
Wow, Wow. Woo Hoo, hoo!

524
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:27,109
Good evening. I'm Talia Kaplan.

525
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:29,245
Joining us tonight
is Evan Kleinman, the

526
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:33,015
CEO of Evan Advanced Robotics
corporation, which is now

527
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:36,218
bringing the tiny kingdom
of Allur back from bankruptcy.

528
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:40,588
Thank you very much for joining
us. So why sex robots and why

529
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:42,124
only the kingdom of Allur?

530
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,525
Okay, First, things first.

531
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:45,394
Is my
Instagram handle down there?

532
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:46,929
Yeah, it is?

533
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:51,033
I'm sorry, what was your
question? Right. Sex robots.

534
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,868
Of course. Um,
yeah sex robots. It

535
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:56,272
was an idea that I've had
brewing in the back of my head

536
00:34:56,405 --> 00:35:00,943
for, gosh, quite some time and
it's a concept I've come back

537
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:05,348
to over and over again. You know
something I really believed in.

538
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,185
You build all your robots right
here in Los Angeles yet you ship

539
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,821
every single one to the
kingdom of Allur. Why?

540
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:14,522
Well
you know I thought it would be a

541
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,659
good place to start. I saw their
country really struggling and

542
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,829
this was an opportunity
to get them back on track.

543
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:23,232
You know at Evanbots
we're all about giving back.

544
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,834
Alright, well when do you plan
to expand and when will you

545
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:28,570
start selling these robots
right here in the United States.

546
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:29,704
Soon, very soon.

547
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,673
The contracts are in place and

548
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:34,576
soon we will
have worldwide distribution.

549
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,278
Alright, well that's all the

550
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:38,747
time we have for tonight thank
you very much Evan Kleinman.

551
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,250
Hold on, is my Instagram
handle down there? Yeah?

552
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:43,119
Can you confirm, is it there?

553
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,853
Alright,
well everybody have a good

554
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,957
night. Thank you
so much for joining us.

555
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,560
Wow, I love that.

556
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,368
Yo that was awesome! Did
you guys see me! My followers

557
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:01,037
are going through the roof.

558
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,938
Barry we gotta
start production on

559
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:04,839
these beautiful
babies immediately.

560
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:07,877
You completely left me out.
You gave me no credit at all.

561
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,180
Dude, I didn't wanna complicate
things, okay?

562
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:13,215
We know you're the real deal.
Let the people think what they

563
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:16,318
want. We're gonna need 10,000 of
these by the end of the month.

564
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:17,420
Can you make that happen?

565
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,421
Wait, wait, 10,000?

566
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:19,455
Yes.

567
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:20,855
Allur already has enough.

568
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:23,225
You weren't serious about
what you said on the TV

569
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,826
show right?
We're not expanding to America.

570
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,362
If we bring the
robots here then what makes

571
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:28,164
Allur so special,
what brings in the tourists?

572
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,632
Look you didn't think we could
limit this to just one

573
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,301
dinky little country did you?

574
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:35,037
If we don't make and sell
these here somebody else will.

575
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:39,942
Believe me, and what
good does that do Allur? Right?

576
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:44,180
Okay, I saved your
kingdom dude. You're welcome.

577
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:45,247
Thank you.

578
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:47,615
Just trust me.

579
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:53,788
I often ask
myself: is technology enough?

580
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:56,125
If it isn't human...

581
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:59,395
If it doesn't touch you...

582
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:01,830
If it doesn't feel you up...

583
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:06,601
and down, then
what is technology?

584
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,703
But one more gizmo

585
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:13,242
on the road to a
cold hard gizmo-ocracy.

586
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,610
Let me put it this way.

587
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:20,349
Sexual satisfaction. What is it?

588
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:24,954
Can you touch it?
Can you hold it?

589
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:29,657
You sure as hell can! Ladies
and gentleman introducing the

590
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:33,262
Evanbots for the
American marketplace!

591
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,973
And just like that the robots

592
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:48,310
were sweeping horny Americans
all over the country.

593
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,846
Yo I hear those robots perform
that zuku zuku shit man.

594
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:55,317
This is what
we needed in America.

595
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,446
Cheers to Evanbots and me
finally moving out of Barry's

596
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,881
crappy apartment.

597
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:28,217
Hey! Why
would you say that?

598
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:30,452
I'm Evan!

599
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,288
Oh.

600
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:33,522
What's your name?

601
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,624
I don't know.

602
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:37,159
You
don't know your own name?

603
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:40,563
No, I don't know if I
want to tell you my name.

604
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:43,432
Oh, well maybe you do. I'm Evan

605
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:47,236
of Evanbots and we're
kind of a hot company right now.

606
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,406
Well, what do you
do, or make, or whatever?

607
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,308
We make sex robots!

608
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:55,344
Ew.

609
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,217
What did you tell her?

610
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:03,252
I don't know.

611
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:07,523
Anyway, Steph you want to
run lines with me tomorrow?

612
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:09,391
Sorry, I got a protest to

613
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:12,328
attend outside
your factory tomorrow.

614
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:14,330
Steph, come on.

615
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:17,333
Okay, Wednesday!

616
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:22,905
Oh, hey! Got here
quicker than I expected.

617
00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:28,810
Guys this is my cousin Vanessa.
Here have a seat.

618
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:31,480
This is Evan.

619
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:34,617
Well I have to go. I have some

620
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,286
coding to get through
before I call it a night.

621
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,888
Okay good night.
Oh, I gotta go to

622
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,757
I'll see you guys.
Good night.

623
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,506
What's your name?

624
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,641
Vanessa.

625
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,042
What is it?

626
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,710
Vanessa.

627
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:03,979
Oh.

628
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:09,585
Although he was now
rich, Evan was still a bitch.

629
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:12,388
We are better
than this as a society.

630
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:16,325
When
men and women aren't equal this

631
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:20,562
kind of grotesque
objectification will not stand!

632
00:40:22,531 --> 00:40:27,136
We aren't against sex. We aren't
against sexuality but we insist

633
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:29,071
on two consenting adults to

634
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:32,908
equal consent. Don't go! Shit!

635
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:39,315
Wow, Steph, Steph. Steph.

636
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:42,685
Again where
are all the protestors?

637
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:44,219
It's not that funny.

638
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:46,955
We are providing maximum
pleasures to people who have

639
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:49,024
difficulty finding pleasure.

640
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:52,695
It's for poor man who is
suffering from anxiety and

641
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,264
doesn't have confidence
and good looks.

642
00:40:55,397 --> 00:40:56,532
What?

643
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,367
It's for man who want to have
sex with women!

644
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,870
And by the way no
one has good looks like me.

645
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,707
It's a blessing from God!

646
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,375
Hey Fahad!

647
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,045
I got to go and good
luck with the protestors!

648
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:15,751
Things were
going great for Evanbots.

649
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:17,453
They got a Jew and an Asian guy

650
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:20,189
with a gray wig to
give them additional funding for

651
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,257
mass production
across the world.

652
00:41:41,744 --> 00:41:44,380
Barry look
at the ratio here. It's a bar

653
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:48,550
full of women. How is it
possible, you're alone again?

654
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:53,422
Look, do you plan on being
a virgin for the rest of your

655
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,358
life?

656
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:59,361
God.

657
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:04,133
You know
you have really nice eyes.

658
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:07,236
Nice eyes? That's all?

659
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:11,640
Oh, and the
bags underneath them.

660
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,242
Oh.

661
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,078
I'm sorry I'm just not used to
being around somebody

662
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,180
so beautiful.

663
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:19,681
You know. You're a lot more

664
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:22,017
charming than
you give yourself credit for.

665
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:24,319
Evan, I'm so glad you made it.

666
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:25,154
Hey!

667
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:26,221
Isn't this place awesome?

668
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:28,557
Yeah, yeah it's incredible.

669
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,292
I'm Rachel, who are you?

670
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:32,694
Vanessa.

671
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:34,596
You lucky girl. Evan must have

672
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,799
shown you his
VR toy in his bedroom.

673
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,701
Oh no, no, no, no.
That's just...

674
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:43,272
Yeah, uh anyway,
good seeing you and sorry for

675
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:46,275
interrupting, but a bunch of us
are going golfing tomorrow with

676
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:47,810
the real stars of Instagram and

677
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,612
since you're way over 500k,
would you want to come?

678
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:53,015
Yes! That would be awesome.

679
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:54,616
Vanessa will join me.

680
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,353
Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,892
Yo bro. I love your robots!

682
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,259
Thank you!

683
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:05,794
Dude, four hours last night
with one.

684
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,163
We aim to please.
It's in our mission statement.

685
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,465
Do you follow me on Instagram?

686
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:11,033
Of course I
follow you on Instagram.

687
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,701
Wait for the updates on the
future bots.

688
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,803
It's gonna blow your mind.

689
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:16,505
Dude I love your selfies!

690
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,706
Thank you.

691
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,174
Evan Kleinman!

692
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,176
Show him the present.

693
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:25,647
Um, we baked
you a special cupcake.

694
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:31,220
Um, thank you?

695
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:33,322
Yeah, thanks.

696
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:36,525
You're welcome bro.
Let's get out of here.

697
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:39,127
See you guys.

698
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,264
Do
you want to get out of here?

699
00:43:42,397 --> 00:43:44,032
Yes.

700
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:12,227
That special cupcake had LSD,

701
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:16,565
CBD, Propecia and Viagra in it.

702
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:42,391
Hey Virgin.

703
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,928
What?

704
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,132
Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!

705
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,603
Virgin Virgin Virgin!

706
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,805
I said stop it!

707
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:15,757
Hey Mate, you got a light?

708
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,562
Hey mister, I don't bite.

709
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:31,975
Mate you alright?

710
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:34,176
You don't bite?

711
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,451
Looks like you need a little
BP. Barry Penis.

712
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:44,319
Say hello to little Barry.

713
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,392
Come to the Barry.

714
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:04,740
This is unacceptable.

715
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:08,477
My client is clearly guilty!
I mean innocent!

716
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,479
You need to
resign immediately otherwise the

717
00:46:10,612 --> 00:46:12,180
entire company will be
in jeopardy.

718
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:14,616
I didn't know what was going on,
I don't remember any of this.

719
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,887
It's all over Facebook,
Instagram, Snapchat.

720
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:19,287
I mean even Twitter.

721
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:21,223
Someone's out to get me.
Evan just tell the media

722
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:22,925
someone's out to get me.

723
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:24,660
Well I'm afraid
that's not going to cut it.

724
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:28,898
Khalid, tell
them this isn't me. Tell them!

725
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:31,233
It looks like you.

726
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:32,300
Fahad?

727
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:34,202
Not you, definitely not you.

728
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,204
Evan will vouch
for me, won't you Evan?

729
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,707
You sexually
assaulted a paparazzo, bro!

730
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,044
I created this!

731
00:46:41,777 --> 00:46:44,346
Look, we got a
golf game to get to.

732
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,850
Get rid of him. Do it quick.
Nothing personal, Barry.

733
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,221
That's not cool!

734
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,825
Don't touch me!

735
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:24,553
Freeze! Darwin here.

736
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:29,691
Oh, will you marry me Maria?

737
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:32,995
My name isn't Maria, but yes.

738
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:34,563
Yes.

739
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:45,774
And last but not
least, Steph and Evan.

740
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:59,454
You had your
chance Jonathan.

741
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,790
I've moved on.

742
00:48:04,693 --> 00:48:07,930
One last time Elizabeth, that's
all I ask. Do the snake

743
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:11,466
dance for me and I'll leave you
alone forever.

744
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,373
One last time.

745
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,363
Wow, Bravo! Bravo!

746
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,433
Okay,
apparently Evan decided to

747
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,138
take the knee on tonight's
performance.

748
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:51,107
But one more question
before we conclude our

749
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,410
evening of horrible theatre.
How many people here noticed

750
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:58,513
that I've lost weight?

751
00:49:04,786 --> 00:49:08,024
How could he do this to me?

752
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,927
Steph, the scene is over.

753
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,595
And remember,
you have an opportunity

754
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:17,133
to get back at him
on national TV tomorrow.

755
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:19,367
Oh shit, the debate is tomorrow.

756
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,735
Yes!

757
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:21,736
Screw it.

758
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:22,537
What?

759
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:23,538
I want to get drunk.

760
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,075
Oh. Oh, no no.

761
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:35,218
You're kinda cute,
you know that?

762
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,086
Yes I know that.

763
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,088
You do?

764
00:49:39,222 --> 00:49:41,090
Of course I do.

765
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:47,429
Do you maybe
want to come back to my place?

766
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:50,665
Steph,
you have tremendous talent but

767
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:52,034
Fahad needs to be with the

768
00:49:52,168 --> 00:49:56,005
prettiest
girl in the world! I'm sorry.

769
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,044
You're talking about yourself
in the third person now?

770
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:03,812
It's the king.
Fahad, we must go at once.

771
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:06,349
Oh, the king,
okay. Take revenge!

772
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:11,287
Oh, okay the king. Cheerio,
governor, pinkies up! Pip pip.

773
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:17,626
Welcome to access Taliwood
with my co-host Rick Rainbow.

774
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:19,295
Hi!

775
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:22,864
Today show is solely dedicated
to talking about Evan Kleinman.

776
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:26,434
That Evan
Kleinman is so hot right now.

777
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,972
Yeah and guys he
is blowing up on social media.

778
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:33,075
I just want to gobble
him up. Yum yum yum yum.

779
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:37,179
This is great news! Are you guys
seeing this? This is incredible.

780
00:50:37,313 --> 00:50:38,747
Alright, I got to go.

781
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:41,317
Wait a minute. I want
to talk to you about Steph.

782
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,551
She's the only thing
on my mind right now, okay?

783
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:45,354
But you stood
her up at the showcase.

784
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:47,023
And she'll get over it.

785
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:50,960
Oh really? You can really
be a dick sometimes. Asshole!

786
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:53,195
So rude.

787
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,131
You know what makes me
the most mad? Is that at the

788
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:57,166
end of this I'm the stupid one
because I thought I'd give him

789
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,800
him a chance to actually
come back and apologize

790
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:00,702
and maybe try to talk
things out, but no, I'm

791
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,972
the stupid one. He's
late to his own stupid show that

792
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:03,805
I agreed to be on.

793
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,974
He's coming.

794
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,976
Unbelievable.

795
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,010
Hey!

796
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:09,979
Hey? Where
were you yesterday?

797
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:11,247
Look, Steph.

798
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,382
You know how important
that showcase was to me.

799
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:16,185
I know and I'm sorry. Okay?

800
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,653
Look I have a
million other things that are

801
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:21,023
more important on
my plate right now.

802
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,125
Other things
like your new friends?

803
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:26,028
I was playing golf with the real
stars of Instagram. Me!

804
00:51:26,162 --> 00:51:29,165
Think about that for a
second. How incredible is that?

805
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:30,632
Wow that's just...

806
00:51:30,765 --> 00:51:31,833
You're an asshole!

807
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:33,802
And I fell asleep.
I had a snooze.

808
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,737
That's
your excuse? Fatigue?

809
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,074
Look the whole
world doesn't revolve around

810
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,742
you and your stupid little
theatre scene. Okay?

811
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:42,411
And in case you haven't noticed.
Wait!

812
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:43,812
I don't even
show up to that anymore!

813
00:51:43,946 --> 00:51:45,348
We used
to be friends, remember?

814
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,614
Yeah, when I was nobody.

815
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:48,483
Oh, you are somebody, alright!

816
00:51:48,616 --> 00:51:50,152
I have followers now!

817
00:51:50,286 --> 00:51:53,322
Yeah, you have herpes following
you from your little girlfriend.

818
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,826
Good evening and thank you for
watching talking with Talia.

819
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,063
Joining us tonight is Evan
Kleinman the CEO of Evan

820
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:04,433
Advanced Robotics Corporation
and we also have Sarah

821
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:06,534
Stein-Goldberg, the
president of the

822
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,871
feminist empowerment mission
advanced level experience, aka

823
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:13,109
female. Thank you both
so very much for joining us.

824
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:17,179
You, a man, don't have the right
to say that your robot girl toys

825
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:18,713
aren't sexist.

826
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:20,849
We're providing entertainment.

827
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:23,452
For men. And what
kind of real man would prefer a

828
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:25,988
doll to a living
breathing woman?

829
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:29,691
Me! That'd be awesome.

830
00:52:29,992 --> 00:52:33,095
There's one guy.
You know you wouldn't believe

831
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:36,531
how realistic the
breathing in our products are.

832
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:39,868
Ugh, aren't you afraid these
plastic computers are going to

833
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:42,405
get hacked, jeopardizing
the lives of millions?

834
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:45,740
No our servers are triple secure

835
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:49,078
and besides
there's a kill switch.

836
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,379
A kill switch?

837
00:52:50,513 --> 00:52:51,646
That's right, with
one click of a button we can

838
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,149
shut them all down.

839
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:57,319
So if your hotbots aren't
sexist, why do you only

840
00:52:57,453 --> 00:52:59,221
manufacture female robots, huh?

841
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:02,058
Why not make male
robots for the females to enjoy?

842
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:05,895
You're right, you're right!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

843
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:07,897
We will immediately
begin development on

844
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,731
male bots for the market.

845
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:12,600
Follow me on Instagram at
Evan the CEO

846
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,970
for updates on male bots!

847
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:17,907
Ah, I'll definitely be trying
one of those! Well that's all

848
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,342
the time we have for tonight
folks. Thank you for watching

849
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:21,609
and have a good night.

850
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:22,912
Thank you Steph!

851
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:24,280
Why did you say that?

852
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,916
We never discussed making
male robots and

853
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:28,918
that's the sort of
thing you need to take to the-

854
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:33,089
Shut up! Alright you work
for me! Look, I was challenged

855
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:36,926
and I took up that challenge.
My followers demand it.

856
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:38,327
This is way
too complicated.

857
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:40,129
The job description
said all we'd have to do

858
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:42,864
is have sex with robots.

859
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:46,135
You know, Barry never really
told us what he was up to.

860
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:49,238
He didn't exactly share.

861
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,806
What the
hell am I paying you guys for?

862
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:55,643
Maybe it is in our best
interest in bringing Barry back.

863
00:53:56,078 --> 00:54:00,116
I agree. One hundred percent.

864
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:05,354
That Evan Kleinman
is so hot right now!

865
00:54:05,488 --> 00:54:09,158
Yeah, and guys he
is blowing up on social media.

866
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:13,195
I just want to gobble him up.
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

867
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:25,207
Hello?

868
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:32,181
No, I'd love to come back.

869
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,535
This or this?

870
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,171
Do you think he's going to come?

871
00:54:55,638 --> 00:54:58,140
I don't know. We'll see.

872
00:55:12,154 --> 00:55:14,089
Thanks for coming
man, I appreciate it.

873
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,091
No Problem.

874
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:20,029
I bet you're
still mad at me, huh?

875
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:24,400
I understand. It
wasn't personal.

876
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:28,170
Exactly, it wasn't. So let's get
back to work man!

877
00:55:28,304 --> 00:55:30,239
You got a company
to build. Let's go.

878
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,308
Let's!

879
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:41,951
Yeah.

880
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:51,060
I have never felt

881
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:54,563
so uncomfortable
making a bot before.

882
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:58,100
Especially the genitals.

883
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:01,136
Would you like a massage?

884
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:14,749
This is what
we needed in America!

885
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,925
That's what I'm saying.

886
00:56:23,058 --> 00:56:24,893
All he does all day
is pay attention to me.

887
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:27,296
It's creeping me out!

888
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:28,897
Hello.

889
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:31,300
I gotta go.

890
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:35,837
What?

891
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:38,307
Do you need a hug?

892
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,109
I do not.

893
00:56:40,242 --> 00:56:43,712
Do you want to tell me
fascinating stories about the

894
00:56:43,845 --> 00:56:48,450
good times you've had with your
female friends. I'm all ears.

895
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:50,919
No I want you to ignore me.

896
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:54,256
Go watch
football on TV, away from me.

897
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,126
But I'm
designed to only look at you.

898
00:56:57,259 --> 00:56:59,628
I give you the night
off! You are free to go.

899
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:03,666
Go have fun with your friends,
get drunk, come home late.

900
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:06,035
Oh, you want to have sex?

901
00:57:06,168 --> 00:57:08,270
No. Oh my god. Where's the box.

902
00:57:08,404 --> 00:57:11,373
I'm sending you back.
I need my money back.

903
00:57:11,507 --> 00:57:14,877
80 percent of the man bots are
being returned! I need a real

904
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:18,681
man! That's what
she says, I need a real man.

905
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,149
Don't they work right?

906
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:21,884
I've heard the sex is fantastic.

907
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:23,352
They work fine!

908
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,954
The sex is fine!
It's not a technical issue.

909
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:27,489
It's their attitude.

910
00:57:33,162 --> 00:57:37,166
Okay, I get it. I get it!
The man bots were a bust.

911
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:39,168
You know,
Steph knew this would happen.

912
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:40,502
She tricked me into this.

913
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:43,372
Hey! Don't
blame this on Steph, okay?

914
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:44,973
Right, We gotta go.

915
00:57:45,107 --> 00:57:46,742
Where are you going?

916
00:57:46,874 --> 00:57:50,779
The big show. Couple of the
year. Homosapian magazine!

917
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:55,984
Homo... Sapians.

918
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:58,187
You'll all be watching. I hope.

919
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,955
Okay good luck.

920
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:04,026
Oh, Barry, what are you doing?

921
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:06,662
Figuring out how
to be able to remotely access

922
00:58:06,795 --> 00:58:09,698
neuro-structures of mammals
to be able to send customized

923
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:11,734
signals spinally and ultimately

924
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:13,902
modify the hypothalamus!

925
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:19,742
Control their minds.

926
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:21,009
Control their minds?

927
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:22,344
Hhm, hmmm.

928
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:25,514
Wow. Okay,
I gotta go to meet Steph.

929
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:28,083
I'll see you.

930
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,936
Hello!

931
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:48,937
Hey!

932
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:50,439
Welcome, come on in.

933
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:52,975
Wow. Cool place.

934
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:55,511
Oh, thank you. Woo.

935
00:58:57,846 --> 00:58:59,948
Hey, I really enjoyed
your script by the way.

936
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:02,251
Oh, thank you,
I owe it to myself.

937
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:04,153
By the way,
Evan and Vanessa are on

938
00:59:04,286 --> 00:59:05,854
TV, we
should probably watch them.

939
00:59:05,988 --> 00:59:07,156
Ugh, do we have to?

940
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:09,925
Yes it's background noise.

941
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:14,630
Fine, but the second he gets
obnoxious we turn it off right?

942
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:26,742
Oh, we're gonna miss it.

943
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:30,145
Right, um, that way?

944
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:31,480
The TV is this way.

945
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,347
Cool.

946
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:35,150
Okay.
I'll be back!

947
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:43,659
Dang, swanky place.

948
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,360
I wish my
parents could get me something

949
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:50,499
like this. What's this?
A big ass photo of you.

950
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,735
Oh.

951
01:00:00,442 --> 01:00:03,512
Hey Steph, here is our scene.

952
01:00:06,215 --> 01:00:09,318
Oh. Ohhhh.

953
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:14,556
Fahad, something wrong?

954
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,694
Is this a mirror?

955
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,195
Fahad, are you okay?

956
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,530
Is this a mirror?

957
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:22,932
Uh, yeah?

958
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:25,033
Is this my face?

959
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,668
You're joking right?

960
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:27,937
Is this me?

961
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,539
Uh, yeah?

962
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,741
No! It's not me!

963
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:36,645
No. Is it a mirror?

964
01:00:36,778 --> 01:00:38,213
Are you okay?

965
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:40,048
It's not me. No it cannot be.

966
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:41,717
Are you like
having a stroke or something?

967
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:42,886
This me?

968
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,219
Fahad, what is it?

969
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:48,023
No! What did you do?

970
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:49,558
That mirror was
covered for a reason!

971
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,560
What? I didn't know!

972
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:56,231
Fahad, Fahad
we have to talk.

973
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,734
There is nothing you can say.

974
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:02,371
I will never
star in any action movies!

975
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:07,010
Fahad, we need to talk. You
have always looked this way.

976
01:01:07,142 --> 01:01:10,178
No! My mom told me that my
father told me that. Everyone

977
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:12,714
told me do not look in mirror.

978
01:01:12,848 --> 01:01:17,386
Look at me now. I cannot
believe this is my face.

979
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:19,755
Fahad you have
always looked this way.

980
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:23,292
The mirror did not make you
ugly. It's just a mirror.

981
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:25,227
There is no curse.

982
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,031
No curse?
This is me? Is this me?

983
01:01:28,163 --> 01:01:30,499
It's always been me?

984
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,335
No, no, no!

985
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:34,938
No, no Fahad. No, no, no!

986
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,140
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you from all my heart!

987
01:01:38,273 --> 01:01:39,408
Fahad?

988
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:40,742
He looked in the
mirror its not my fault!

989
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:41,945
I swear it's not my fault!

990
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,779
You lied to me, why?

991
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:48,417
You are beautiful on the inside.

992
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,719
Fahad, we were
trying to protect you.

993
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:53,422
Your mother, she
wanted you to be happy.

994
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:57,026
By hiding me from my own image?
Screw everything. Screw the

995
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:59,761
Screw the company.
Screw the kingdom.

996
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:04,266
Do not ever call
me again. Do not call me.

997
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,705
Never. Do not call me!

998
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,585
Come on Evan, pick up!

999
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:27,456
Evans phone here.
Do you follow me on Instagram?

1000
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:32,794
If you don't I will not call you
back. At Evan the CEO.

1001
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:40,636
Despite the companies failure
with the manbots, Evan's stardom

1002
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:45,140
and relationship with Vanessa
rose to new levels of fame.

1003
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:48,477
Good evening everyone! And thank
you for watching goodnight with

1004
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:53,016
Talia. We have a fantastic
guest for you tonight, Evanessa!

1005
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,483
Couple of the year,

1006
01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:57,887
welcome, welcome.
Hi, nice to meet you.

1007
01:02:58,021 --> 01:03:01,490
Nice to see you again. Thank
you for being here and folks

1008
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:04,760
we are breaking every records
rating for a Tuesday night in

1009
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:08,031
July. Congratulations on being
named couple of the year.

1010
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,032
Thank you.

1011
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,900
Please have a seat.

1012
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:12,868
So tell me Evan how
did you guys first meet?

1013
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:15,905
Well we actually
met through her cousin, Barry.

1014
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,308
Probably the strangest, funniest
looking little guy I've ever

1015
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:23,612
known and he's Vanessa's
cousin and we were at

1016
01:03:23,745 --> 01:03:26,515
Throw rooftop lounge one
night and she was there to meet

1017
01:03:26,648 --> 01:03:28,717
him and
we've hit it off ever since.

1018
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,786
Oh, how romantic.

1019
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,855
Well, your robots, they are so
real why date a

1020
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,390
real woman, no offense.

1021
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:38,460
Well, yes our
robots are perfect,

1022
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:41,263
I mean perfection
personified but, uh-

1023
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:44,466
it's Vanessa's flaws
that I'm in love with.

1024
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:46,535
Ohhhh....

1025
01:03:46,668 --> 01:03:48,837
Well, how does
it feel to be so famous, so

1026
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:53,241
beautiful, so successful, toast
of the town. Couple of the year.

1027
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,078
It feels
sensational Tamara. Just-

1028
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,445
Talia.

1029
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:59,015
Whatever, Tamara.
It's sensational and it

1030
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:01,550
feels really, really good.

1031
01:04:01,683 --> 01:04:04,219
Yeah and there's a lot of people
I'd like to thank, uh,

1032
01:04:04,352 --> 01:04:07,222
starting with, um,

1033
01:04:07,355 --> 01:04:09,058
whatever, it doesn't matter
I don't remember their names

1034
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:14,596
anyways. But there is one thing
I would like to add.

1035
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:18,968
Vanessa, you
would be the perfect addition-

1036
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:20,903
to my portfolio.

1037
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:24,773
Oh my goodness,
it appears we have a proposal.

1038
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,109
What do you say?

1039
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:28,610
Will you marry me?

1040
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:30,579
Buenisimo.

1041
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:32,115
Oh, you speak Spanish.

1042
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:35,450
Suburashi. Zeh Tov Maod!

1043
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:38,587
Marhabban Marhabban Marhabban.

1044
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,024
Yes proceed to the
route. In and Out burger.

1045
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:43,291
Should we go to the sahara tent?

1046
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:44,359
Vanessa, the
whole world is watching.

1047
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:45,393
What are you doing?

1048
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:47,897
Pie equals 3.14159265359.

1049
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,099
Baby, baby, baby...

1050
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:53,936
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1051
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,673
Oh, my goodness! Breaking news
Vanessa is a robot!

1052
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:03,278
No! No!

1053
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:06,115
Evan, you're
a cheat. You're a fraud.

1054
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:08,151
No, no, no, no, no.
Get that off!

1055
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,219
You saw it here first guys.

1056
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:12,821
No! Vanessa, hey!

1057
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,057
Can you believe it?

1058
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:18,393
She was a robot
and he didn't even notice it.

1059
01:05:18,527 --> 01:05:21,863
What an idiot!

1060
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,836
Ooh. Ooh.

1061
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:36,845
SeÃ±orita? Uh, hello? Help! Help!

1062
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:41,483
Hello, anyone? Help?

1063
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:50,893
All around the
world the robots were shutting

1064
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:52,895
off, but who did it?

1065
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,997
Even the
few remaining male bots

1066
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:57,599
were shutting down as well.

1067
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:40,442
It doesn't sicken
you to sit with someone so ugly?

1068
01:06:40,575 --> 01:06:42,711
You're not ugly.

1069
01:06:42,844 --> 01:06:46,715
Thank you, but
you are wrong about that.

1070
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,718
Looks aren't everything.
Haven't you ever heard

1071
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:51,586
don't judge a
book by it's cover.

1072
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,891
Writers say this,
publishers know it's not true.

1073
01:06:55,024 --> 01:06:57,726
Well, your script
has nothing to do with looks and

1074
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:01,197
it's very good.
Beautiful in fact.

1075
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:05,101
What is this? Why
you didn't tell me I was ugly?

1076
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:08,337
Why? Why! What is this?

1077
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,040
You didn't ask.

1078
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:18,147
I was attracted to you
because of your attitude anyway.

1079
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:22,885
Confidence is hot.

1080
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:28,423
Really? I like that.

1081
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,859
I like this.

1082
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:33,963
What is this?
What is this?

1083
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:47,742
Hey, Good morning.

1084
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:51,380
Morning.

1085
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:53,581
Son, did you sleep well?

1086
01:07:53,715 --> 01:07:56,185
Do you still fit into your bed?

1087
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,421
Yeah.

1088
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:02,224
Listen, you know
we're very proud of you.

1089
01:08:03,591 --> 01:08:05,127
Don't be.

1090
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:08,397
What are you talking about? You
made so much money and you went

1091
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,798
after what you wanted.

1092
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:11,800
Yeah, I abandoned all my friends

1093
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:16,405
to fall in love with a robot
and now I'm left with nothing.

1094
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:19,474
I know that this is what you
don't want to be right now,

1095
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:23,812
back home with your parents.
What you had is what you wanted,

1096
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:27,216
were you ever actually happy?

1097
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:32,989
Yeah, I thought I was, you know.

1098
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:35,958
But looking back at it,
Vanessa, just

1099
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:39,996
did whatever I wanted and
agreed with everything I said.

1100
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,697
And
you know she never did fart.

1101
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:45,734
Farting is not good
for relationships.

1102
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:47,403
Listen to me,

1103
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:51,440
I know that you and I haven't
seen eye to eye and I know I've

1104
01:08:51,573 --> 01:08:53,242
been very tough on you, but this

1105
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:56,745
is the best advice
I can give you right now.

1106
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:06,489
Listen to me,

1107
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:10,558
fame and success can give you a
sense of false confidence.

1108
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:14,997
Here you have the fame.
Here you have the success.

1109
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:17,732
You have an opportunity here!

1110
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,868
Which is what?

1111
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:23,638
From everything bad something
good comes out.

1112
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:26,608
Use your notoriety
for good things.

1113
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:29,345
Heal your inner wounds.

1114
01:09:29,478 --> 01:09:32,081
Amend your wrong doing.

1115
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:35,885
And make it up to your
friends by doing something good.

1116
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:41,090
Isn't that all what the bots are
about, helping lonely men?

1117
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:45,995
I mean, Yeah I guess.
In a way, sure.

1118
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:54,437
Oh my God, I hate my life.

1119
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,385
Ah! I can't feel
the zuku zuku with you.

1120
01:10:09,518 --> 01:10:11,353
Excuse me, the what?

1121
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:16,292
I would love to be alone,
would you please just leave?

1122
01:10:17,126 --> 01:10:20,196
My pleasure.

1123
01:10:22,064 --> 01:10:24,300
I know you
are a hot girl...

1124
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:28,370
Sorry.

1125
01:10:29,371 --> 01:10:31,307
Hey! Fahad around?

1126
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,707
Oh, that looks good.

1127
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:35,677
I know. Just don't touch.

1128
01:10:35,978 --> 01:10:40,648
I'm so beautiful, woohoo!

1129
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,817
So beautiful!

1130
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:45,154
Someone's feeling better.

1131
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,356
Oh guys, I have news from Allur.

1132
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,493
With the robots gone, tourism is
back up a tad, but-

1133
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,495
it's still a bad situation.

1134
01:10:52,694 --> 01:10:56,265
My movie could have saved
Allur, but we don't have money.

1135
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:58,334
No money. No honey.

1136
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,701
No.

1137
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:02,104
No? We didn't
lose all that money?

1138
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:04,974
Do you think I'm some kind
of dummy? I cashed in our

1139
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:07,709
investment after we made a
killing on the American Launch.

1140
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:10,712
Wow! Wow!
Wow! So amazing!

1141
01:11:10,845 --> 01:11:13,048
Man you are so beautiful.

1142
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:14,483
So are you.

1143
01:11:14,617 --> 01:11:17,319
So Khalid if you guys sold your
stake in Evanbots like forever

1144
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:19,588
ago, what were
you guys still doing there?

1145
01:11:19,721 --> 01:11:22,657
I liked having friends.

1146
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:25,427
Plus it was a way to keep
Fahad away from mirrors.

1147
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:29,331
Yeah. I know who's going
to be the star in my movie.

1148
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:32,535
Well. You're going to have
talk to my agent about that.

1149
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,203
I thought you
were my agent too.

1150
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,405
I'm nobody's agent.

1151
01:11:39,807 --> 01:11:43,179
Bye Fahad!

1152
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:46,382
Who's this?

1153
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:50,319
She is no one.

1154
01:11:50,452 --> 01:11:51,887
Where are you going?

1155
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,323
Hey come on Steph!

1156
01:11:55,224 --> 01:12:00,029
What did I do, what with
all the girls. Oh my...

1157
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,365
Oh, she brought this for me?

1158
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:07,069
Uh huh, enjoy.

1159
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,038
Wow, Steph!

1160
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:11,706
You know just last
week I was having a heart to

1161
01:12:11,839 --> 01:12:16,912
heart with my weed smoking
construction working dad the

1162
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:20,616
other day and it made me realize

1163
01:12:20,748 --> 01:12:25,820
that what I thought
I wanted wasn't in fact true.

1164
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:28,057
I was just
seeking fame for all the wrong

1165
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:32,928
reasons and I realized that I,
me, myself.

1166
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:34,930
Was enough and I didn't

1167
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:38,267
need Instagram followers to feel

1168
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,938
complete and um, you
know I quickly realized

1169
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:46,175
that farting in relationships
that was important,

1170
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:49,744
not the fame, not the followers.

1171
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:54,416
And I really owe my dad for that
one. Even if he is a stoner.

1172
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:59,555
Thank you so much, I'll take
any questions you might have.

1173
01:12:59,688 --> 01:13:01,290
Yeah, you in the front.

1174
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:04,426
Um, what was it like when you
realized you hit your lowest.

1175
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,729
My lowest?

1176
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:10,966
I'm horny!

1177
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:15,170
Um that's not really a
question, but okay. You there!

1178
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:17,172
I'm horny, too!

1179
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:19,375
Babe what are you doing?
We just got back from Cabo.

1180
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:22,411
Also not a question.
These aren't questions!

1181
01:13:22,544 --> 01:13:25,047
Fahad! Get out of here!

1182
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,182
Fahad! The warehouse!

1183
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:30,519
I'm horny! I'm horny. I'm horny.

1184
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:41,263
Hi Steph.

1185
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:46,001
I liked the cake.

1186
01:13:46,135 --> 01:13:49,972
You probably
think I'm a sexist asshole.

1187
01:13:51,006 --> 01:13:55,277
Steph when
I found out I was ugly,

1188
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:58,147
I wasn't sure if I
could be attractive anymore.

1189
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,317
So you had to get
your dick wet to test it out.

1190
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,919
Yes.

1191
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:06,854
How'd that work out for you?

1192
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:09,358
Terrible.

1193
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,360
Good.

1194
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:13,362
Steph,

1195
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:18,634
I feel
different when I'm around you.

1196
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:20,369
You do?

1197
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:24,807
Yes, I do. Because you
accepted me for who I am and

1198
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:30,245
allowed me to accept myself. You
make me feel like I'm enough.

1199
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:38,087
That eyebrow is enough.

1200
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:49,698
I'm so horny. I'm so horny.

1201
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:51,400
I'm so horny. I'm so horny.

1202
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:52,534
No, no, no, no!

1203
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:53,569
Woah, woah, woah.

1204
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,937
I'm so horny. So horny.

1205
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,039
No, no, no, no!
Woah, woah, woah!

1206
01:14:57,172 --> 01:14:58,807
So horny. So horny!

1207
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:00,409
It's not the right place.

1208
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,544
Oh, huh, ho.

1209
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:04,747
What are you doing?
It's not the right place.

1210
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,281
Oh!

1211
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:09,418
Quite the overactive
hypothalamus she has there.

1212
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,253
Barry,

1213
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:14,957
Barry, to the warehouse.
Barry-

1214
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,291
Barry!

1215
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:18,227
Fahad help!

1216
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,564
You go save yourself,
it's too late for me!

1217
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:25,601
State and
local officials are warning

1218
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,904
everyone to stay inside lock
your doors and close your

1219
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:32,574
windows. Or don't.

1220
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:37,579
Ooh, It's getting hot in here.
Ooh.

1221
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:38,847
You know what?

1222
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:41,316
That's all the time we have for-

1223
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,051
Gotta go!

1224
01:15:56,265 --> 01:16:00,869
Barry! Barry! Barry!
The switch. Barry!

1225
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:02,337
You!
What are you doing here?

1226
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:03,572
Darwin.

1227
01:16:03,705 --> 01:16:05,340
Do not call me Darwin.
I am not Darwin anymore.

1228
01:16:05,474 --> 01:16:06,742
Okay! Douchebag!

1229
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:09,945
I knew that you were
causing all these problems.

1230
01:16:10,078 --> 01:16:11,079
Me?
Yes, you!

1231
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:12,448
Me?
Yes, you!

1232
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:14,216
You're the one who
destroyed this company,

1233
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:16,718
ruined my life by hitting the
kill switch and now

1234
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:17,887
you want to torment me further?

1235
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,922
I didn't do that.

1236
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:19,889
It was you.

1237
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:21,623
No! Darwin, It was you.

1238
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:25,929
You and your disgusting moles
and stupid singular eyebrow.

1239
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:27,763
Hey guys.

1240
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:45,113
Long time, no see my friends!

1241
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,182
Welcome back to Evanbots.

1242
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:50,619
Or should I say Barry Bots.

1243
01:16:50,752 --> 01:16:54,823
The company,
The company that I created!

1244
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,525
Oh you have nothing to say?

1245
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:57,526
Oh, oh.

1246
01:17:00,462 --> 01:17:02,531
You didn't
tell me Vanessa was a robot.

1247
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:04,934
Whoah!

1248
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:08,737
I created Vanessa
to amp up your self esteem.

1249
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:10,940
Hey! You're welcome.

1250
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:15,344
Also you said no one could
ever fall in love with a robot.

1251
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:18,313
Well you did, didn't you.

1252
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:19,114
Boop!

1253
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:20,415
Ah go to Hell.

1254
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:22,818
I thought we were friends.

1255
01:17:22,952 --> 01:17:25,889
And then you kicked me
out of my own company!

1256
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,223
And because you two ruined me

1257
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,560
I was the one who
shut everything down.

1258
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:34,363
What? You didn't do it?

1259
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:37,099
I just told
you, I didn't do this.

1260
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:41,336
Shhhh.

1261
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:44,974
I wanted you two
to witness me losing my

1262
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,543
virginity first hand.

1263
01:17:47,676 --> 01:17:48,810
Drumroll please.

1264
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:50,445
Oh!

1265
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:52,080
Wooo!!

1266
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:54,583
I created a bioweapon

1267
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:57,386
that affects the neurons in
women and

1268
01:17:57,519 --> 01:18:01,623
allows me to control them.

1269
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:08,797
Barry! Barry Barry Barry Barry!

1270
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:16,738
Holy shit.

1271
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:20,475
Yes! Every woman in the
world now wants to have sex

1272
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:25,814
with me. Real women, not rubber.

1273
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:30,987
No no no no, No!
Oh fudge.

1274
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,855
Enjoy the show boys.

1275
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:43,732
Barry! Barry! Barry. Barry.

1276
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:53,508
Darwin.

1277
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:54,676
I'm not Darwin.

1278
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:58,113
You are Darwin.
You've always been Darwin.

1279
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:00,984
Darwin, think!

1280
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:02,317
Hi. I'm Steph.

1281
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:03,452
Steph, nice to meet you.

1282
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,021
Nice to meet you too.

1283
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:08,091
I was attracted to you
because of your attitude anyway.

1284
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:10,927
I feel different
when I'm around you.

1285
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,829
Wow. Bravo, bravo.

1286
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:17,265
STEPH; Your kinda
cute you know that.

1287
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:26,009
It is I, Darwin to the rescue.

1288
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:28,377
Now bite the rope off.

1289
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,811
Why am I doing the biting?

1290
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:31,914
Because you have
those nice American teeth.

1291
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:32,982
Do it!

1292
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:35,283
Alright, alright!

1293
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:38,787
Oh no! Noooo!

1294
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:43,458
Barry! Barry! Barry!

1295
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:51,600
Woooohooo!

1296
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:55,303
Yes, Untie me.
Darwin untie me. Go!

1297
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:57,706
Darwin Save us!

1298
01:19:57,839 --> 01:20:01,376
What if? What if?

1299
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:11,219
What happened?
What's going on? What?

1300
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:14,723
Where are you going?

1301
01:20:14,856 --> 01:20:15,524
Where are we?

1302
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:16,926
Who the hell are you?

1303
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,794
Ew, what a creep.
Let's get out of here.

1304
01:20:18,928 --> 01:20:20,328
Come back!

1305
01:20:20,462 --> 01:20:23,066
Barry! Of course it was
you. You and your virginity.

1306
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:24,067
Evan.

1307
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:25,068
I knew it was you.

1308
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,069
I didn't mean to do it.

1309
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:29,738
Steph?

1310
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:30,940
Where's Fahad?

1311
01:20:31,074 --> 01:20:31,941
In here.

1312
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:33,876
Fahad!

1313
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,645
Fahad! Fahad!

1314
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,550
Oh my God.
I'm so glad you're okay.

1315
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:45,754
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm so happy to see you.

1316
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:48,490
I'm so happy too.

1317
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:51,860
Don't move. It's over.

1318
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,563
Hey you guys!
Oh my god I'm so happy to

1319
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,100
see you. Look I
was such a dick and

1320
01:20:57,232 --> 01:21:00,469
I'm sorry I can see that now.
Okay, the fame, it just,

1321
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:02,138
it went to my head.

1322
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,208
Alright? I don't know how else
to put this, but you guys are my

1323
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,076
best friends.
Will you forgive me?

1324
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,611
Oh Fahad. I love you buddy.

1325
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,948
You are beautiful.
Thank you so much.

1326
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:13,983
Don't be a
dick sometimes.

1327
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:15,051
I love you.

1328
01:21:15,184 --> 01:21:17,419
It's good to have you back.

1329
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,055
Darwin you saved us.

1330
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:21,924
I'm not
Darwin. I'm Fahad.

1331
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:23,993
I love you guys.

1332
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:25,995
We love you too.

1333
01:22:02,098 --> 01:22:04,066
I don't get it.
Aren't they like royal?

1334
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,902
Why are they getting
married in her backyard?

1335
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:09,939
It's a jewish wedding. The
bride side pays for everything.

1336
01:22:10,106 --> 01:22:13,575
We are gathered here
today to witness the generic

1337
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:18,580
non-denominational union of two
beautiful people, Fahad and

1338
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:23,052
Steph, who I had the great
pleasure to meet just last week.

1339
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:27,355
Oh father!

1340
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:28,356
Fahad!

1341
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,724
What are you doing here?

1342
01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:31,827
You saved the kingdom!
Everybody wants to come

1343
01:22:31,961 --> 01:22:35,231
to Allur to see famous
action Hollywood movie star

1344
01:22:35,363 --> 01:22:37,432
Fahad Bin Alawi!

1345
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:38,700
The country is abuzz.

1346
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:41,003
Tourism is back
and stronger than ever.

1347
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:42,337
Woo! That's incredible!

1348
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,106
Fahad, you're incredible.

1349
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,876
Thank you. Thank you.

1350
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,011
Kiss the bride.

1351
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:51,580
You may now kiss the bride.

1352
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:57,220
And so Fahad did it.
He became a famous action movie

1353
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:01,891
star and he saved his country
all at the same time.

1354
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:05,493
Life was good
for the ugly fellow.

1355
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:12,034
Hello.

1356
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:13,903
Hi, Congratulations.

1357
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:15,104
Thank you.

1358
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:16,705
Where are you two
going on your honeymoon?

1359
01:23:16,838 --> 01:23:19,708
Oh, we
are going to North Dakota.

1360
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,711
Oh yes, the
obvious choice of course.

1361
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:24,779
For the opening of
Sex Action the movie.

1362
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:26,715
Oh, we won't be
there for a long time because

1363
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,919
we are going to open
movie studios in Allur.

1364
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:33,588
You're saying there's going
to be a sequel to the remake of

1365
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,490
the adaptation
of the television show?

1366
01:23:35,624 --> 01:23:37,059
Absolutely.

1367
01:23:37,193 --> 01:23:38,727
Well who's going to be
in it except for you, of course.

1368
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,729
Oh, you will
have to ask my agent.

1369
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:42,731
No, no, no. My
client deserves 10 times that

1370
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,733
amount are you crazy?

1371
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:47,370
I will tell you
one thing. There will be a big

1372
01:23:47,535 --> 01:23:50,472
part for my friend Evan!

1373
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:56,279
Fahad, no no no.
I'm done with the spotlight man.

1374
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:57,479
It's over.

1375
01:23:57,612 --> 01:24:00,548
Is that Darwin? Hi!

1376
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:02,817
Hi ladies. How you doing?

1377
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:04,954
My God, sorry. Can we take a
picture with you? Please...

1378
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,222
Yeah, of course.

1379
01:24:06,355 --> 01:24:07,622
Oh my God. I can't
believe this is happening.

1380
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,059
Thank you so much!

1381
01:24:10,192 --> 01:24:12,295
Darwin! Wow, Wow, Wow!!

1382
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:14,297
Darwin here. I can't believe it!

1383
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:17,666
Fahad, I'm so proud of you, you
showed the world that you can be

1384
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:20,403
not hot and
still be an action movie star.

1385
01:24:20,535 --> 01:24:21,971
Yes.

1386
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:25,874
That's awesome, Darwin!

1387
01:24:29,979 --> 01:24:30,845
Hey.

1388
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:31,646
Hi.

1389
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,847
How's it going?

1390
01:24:32,982 --> 01:24:33,682
Good.

1391
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:34,849
Pretty good wedding, huh?

1392
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:36,851
Mhm, yeah.

1393
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:38,620
Um-

1394
01:24:38,753 --> 01:24:40,923
Before we flirt any further,

1395
01:24:41,057 --> 01:24:45,328
you, you aren't a
robot by chance are you?

1396
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,861
No.

1397
01:24:46,996 --> 01:24:47,862
No?

1398
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:49,398
No.

1399
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:50,433
Do you want to dance?

1400
01:24:50,565 --> 01:24:51,833
Yeah.

1401
01:24:51,968 --> 01:24:55,470
Thank you. Meet
me on the dance floor. Come on.
