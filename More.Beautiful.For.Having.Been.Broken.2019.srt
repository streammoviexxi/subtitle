1
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,573
Life isn't
measured by the number

2
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,175
of breaths we take.

3
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,481
But by the moments that
take our breath away.

4
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,833
FBI Los Angeles 224.

5
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,668
This is Agent
Solomon, code 6GTM.

6
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,006
Yeah, it's DeRitter,
31522NG

7
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,141
I'm gonna need a cover
for Lake Mervielle.

8
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,644
It's located in
Northern California.

9
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,045
I don't know how
long I'm staying,

10
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,348
but just send it to my phone.

11
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,318
10 four,
DeRitter, will do.

12
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,626
Marigo, Marigold?

13
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,027
Lake Mervielle.

14
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,332
It looks like
there's fish in there, mom.

15
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,708
The fall she
returned to Lake Mervielle

16
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,909
everything changed.

17
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,419
What the fuck were you thinking?

18
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,596
You almost got yourself killed,

19
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,322
not to mention your backup.

20
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:44,358
Please, I have a baby!

21
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,393
Let her go.

22
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,135
Yes, she was
running, but she had no idea

23
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,472
why she chose to come
back here of all places.

24
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,325
Holy Christ!

25
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,627
Oh my God, shit I'm sorry.

26
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,438
I can't
believe this is happening.

27
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,163
I heard a scream earlier.

28
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,097
Was that you?

29
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,766
Just wanted to go for a swim.

30
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,600
Now I can't.

31
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,101
Only time that I have.

32
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,503
Okay.

33
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,614
Would you mind?

34
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,040
Isn't it a little Autumn
for a dip in the lake?

35
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,444
Is that any of your business?

36
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:39,780
Oh!

37
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,281
Oh, here.

38
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,249
I'm fine, I'm fine.

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,016
Just get off me.

40
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,984
Okay.

41
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,586
I just,

42
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,788
can you tell me which one
of these god forsaken roads

43
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,256
leads to Lake Mervielle?

44
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,158
At our reunion last
year my college roommate

45
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,827
told me about her
amazing rustic cabin.

46
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,128
Got an address?

47
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,163
Yeah.

48
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,932
Oh, it's in the car.

49
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you mind?

50
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,002
If that isn't too much to ask.

51
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,840
So who was
your college roommate?

52
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,208
Heather Adams.

53
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,309
Heather?

54
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,045
Well, quite a character,

55
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,848
but no one's heard
from her in forever.

56
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,619
What did you say your name was?

57
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,489
McKenzie Aaron, and you?

58
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,566
She remembered her mother saying

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,669
the sleepy berg was filled
with rather eccentric

60
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,806
and colorful characters
right out of the novel.

61
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,640
I think that has,

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,341
see that has a
little bit of a red.

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,346
I got it.

64
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,351
Hi,
I'm here for cabin keys.

65
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,986
Yeah, come on in.

66
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,197
And you've got a few of the
new ones together over that.

67
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,334
It's too challenging for you.

68
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,936
Shame on you!

69
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,872
I'm sorry, and you are?

70
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:12,706
McKenzie.

71
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,274
McKenzie.

72
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,385
I'm here for the
Heather Adams cabin.

73
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,853
Property manager said they'd
leave the key with you?

74
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,112
- Ah yes.
- Right, I am so sorry.

75
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,783
We were just giving Colin's
latest masterpiece a test run.

76
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,884
Hold on one sec.

77
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,287
Grand Pants is famous.

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,922
Oh no, not even remotely.

79
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,624
He designs puzzles, look.

80
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,125
Wow.

81
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,327
First glance, it just looks
like part of the design.

82
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,864
But when you look
closer you can see

83
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,033
that each and every piece
has it's own little story.

84
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,937
And it isn't until you put
all those pieces together

85
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,040
that you can actually
see the big picture.

86
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,776
I used to do puzzles with my mom

87
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,544
but nothing like this.

88
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,780
My mom thinks they
are a waste of time.

89
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,148
Like, what's the point
of sticking thousands

90
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,826
of cardboard pieces
together, if you could just

91
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,786
go to the store,
buy a print and frame it?

92
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,653
That's hardly the point.

93
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,154
Right?

94
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:01,989
Here you go.

95
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,356
- Oh thanks.
- You are welcome.

96
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,994
So if you need any
help getting settled in

97
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,296
my granddaughter here
lives to be of service.

98
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,498
No, I've got it.

99
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,532
Thank you.

100
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,368
Okay.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,108
Who am I?

102
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,944
I just happen to be the
sole writer slash editor

103
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,680
and distributor of the
Pine Mountain Gazette,

104
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:31,118
which serves all 929
readers in a 50 mile radius.

105
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,322
Of all the stories
I've watched unfold

106
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,325
hers is by far my
personal favorite.

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,538
Hey.

108
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:25,573
Hey kid?

109
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,375
Are you supposed to
be out here alone?

110
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,209
Where's your mom?

111
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,510
Teaching, where's yours?

112
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
Touch it?

113
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,893
Soft things melt hard things.

114
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,035
Um,
hey I've gotta be somewhere.

115
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,638
I'm sorry about what I said.

116
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,212
Who is taking care of you?

117
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:09,683
As long as the Fabio
Ladies Book Club can see me

118
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:10,684
I'm okay.

119
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,588
My mom, she makes me
wear this just in case.

120
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,024
One time I got lost...

121
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,258
Yeah, yeah I got it.

122
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,861
Okay, I'm just gonna go and
make sure they know you're here.

123
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,664
Better 'cause I could be
halfway to Mexico by now.

124
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,204
She was only
here because she had promised

125
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,740
her mother she would return.

126
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,380
While she was a little
too city for these parts

127
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,683
she had never broken
her word to her mom.

128
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,785
She wouldn't start now.

129
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,356
She had no tolerance
for patience.

130
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,108
She thought she might
go mad from boredom.

131
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,846
And she was sick of
this rustic cabin.

132
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,486
She ventured into town,

133
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,464
where the Pine
Mountain Inn served

134
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,292
as the General Store,
Post Office and gossip central.

135
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,696
Hey you!

136
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,330
Hey, come join us.

137
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,199
I don't think I
caught your name.

138
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,033
McKenzie.

139
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,201
But most people call me Max.

140
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,302
Cass.

141
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:39,873
May I present Boy of a
Million Adventures, Freddie.

142
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,476
And this one you've met
is still my mother, Adele.

143
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,646
And that handsome
devil is Rodney,

144
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,149
proprietor of Rodney's
Rodeo Bar and Grill.

145
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,784
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

146
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:51,952
Lovely to meet you.

147
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,621
Within two
visits she learned Colin

148
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,791
had been a highly revered
philosophy professor

149
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,693
until he chucked
it all one night,

150
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,395
moved into town,
and began to design

151
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,198
his complex and
intricate puzzles.

152
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,670
Widowed, he met the highly
controversial Cassandra,

153
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,306
an anti-feminist feminist
who believed women

154
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,408
could be insanely powerful

155
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,377
and still be full
of grace and beauty.

156
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,916
Let me crash upon your shores,

157
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,251
shipwrecking your thighs.

158
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,685
Promise?

159
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,990
She quickly
came to understand why.

160
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,426
Mama Adele, founder of the Fabio
Ladies Book Club

161
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,495
and daughter Cass,
were known to all

162
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,664
as the Endless Bickersons.

163
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,837
She heard a term
called Freddie vision,

164
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,939
but she would have no
idea what that meant

165
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:46,974
until much later.

166
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,974
You know what I
love more than rice pudding?

167
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:14,134
What,
my sweet daughter?

168
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,168
Star Ventures!

169
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,707
When the last star
in the sky disappears

170
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,110
we begin our star venture.

171
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,813
And there is only
one rule for the day.

172
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:29,516
No rules, we just go
wherever our will takes us.

173
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,924
She had no use for nostalgia.

174
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:40,460
Bristled at the cloying,
bittersweet memories.

175
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,732
If she couldn't bury
herself in her work

176
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,400
she would run.

177
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,504
In any event,
grief would not best her.

178
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:07,855
If you go in there,
you're gonna

179
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,056
get her killed yourself.

180
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,791
Wait for the negotiator.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,369
I've never seen a
mother daughter any closer

182
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,403
than the two of you.

183
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
We all loved her.

184
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,675
She was one of a kind.

185
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,511
But you didn't take
the time you needed.

186
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,683
I can see the fear in your eyes.

187
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,852
I have a baby please!

188
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:39,887
Let her go!

189
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,356
Do you got the fucking balls?

190
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,528
I'll fucking waste her!

191
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,362
Do it!

192
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,997
You're off the case.

193
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,032
Off doing it.

194
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,436
90 days.

195
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,841
Your grief is a scraggy bitch.

196
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,180
And she doesn't give a royal
fuck about best intentions

197
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,849
or whether you have the
luxury of waiting her out.

198
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,620
You've gotta find a way
through this pain, Max.

199
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,654
Not around it.

200
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,762
Hey!

201
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,797
Hey.

202
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,266
Glad I caught you actually.

203
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,278
Grand Pants wanted to know
if you wanted to come in

204
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,837
for some full moon mud pie.

205
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,307
I'm not much of
a dessert person.

206
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,608
This is not just a dessert.

207
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,843
This is a life
changing experience.

208
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,178
You need to be here.

209
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,479
He only makes it once a month.

210
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,181
You don't wanna get FOMO.

211
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,216
It's real.

212
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,785
Oh and we're about to
start a new puzzle.

213
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,463
You look like you're trying
to keep yourself busy

214
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,157
and this is not
the place for that.

215
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,427
Well, I definitely don't wanna
get FOMO.

216
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,294
Great.

217
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,862
We start around like seven.

218
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,533
All right then.

219
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,606
Colin's full moon mud pie

220
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,543
came from the monthly
celestial event

221
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,547
which made the inky night
sky brilliant with stars

222
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,915
and became the blueprint
for his puzzles.

223
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,461
You can start,
you don't have to wait.

224
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,662
Okay, thanks.

225
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,367
Oh my God, that is so good.

226
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,535
Right,
I tell him he should be a chef.

227
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,538
My darling man.

228
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,806
Oh, thank you darling.

229
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,907
All right let's see.

230
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,009
What have we got here?

231
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,511
Where are we?

232
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,480
Mademoiselle does borders.

233
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,348
Yes, oui oui
mademoiselle does borders

234
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,585
and the straight edged
pieces align themselves

235
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,154
with earth or sky.

236
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,489
God, I know this.

237
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,492
Lost In Translation,
the James Merle poem.

238
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,194
Every time they
start a new puzzle,

239
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,895
they quote it like scripture.

240
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:14,367
Nothing is lost or
all else is translation.

241
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:19,606
And every bit
of us is lost in it.

242
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,976
Um yeah,
puzzle as existential metaphor.

243
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,712
Right.

244
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,013
Go get some full moon.

245
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,014
Yes sir.

246
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,582
This is McKenzie.

247
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,517
Hi.

248
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,686
This gad fly is
Gabrielle's sister,

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,689
my granddaughter who
I like sometimes.

250
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,260
In spite of
herself she was enjoying

251
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,294
the company.

252
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,599
And that damn pie, it was the
best thing she'd eaten

253
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,535
since she got there.

254
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,779
After much urging
she finally sat in

255
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,814
on the weekly Friday
chess tournament.

256
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,049
Are you in?

257
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh.

258
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,153
Get in.

259
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,754
Okay, let's do this.

260
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,358
Such disappointment
is coming your way.

261
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,026
You don't know my chess
skills, okay?

262
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,229
Right.

263
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,073
He's gonna whip
you like a rented mule.

264
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,599
I'm just telling you up front.

265
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,839
He seems harmless.

266
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,777
Like a lovely woodland
creature, but no.

267
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,918
This is the part where
he sneaks up on you.

268
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,321
No, no, no, not that.

269
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,323
Like a monkey in the woods.

270
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,825
Nice, but check mate!

271
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah, it's humbling, isn't it?

272
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,767
Yes it is.

273
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,670
As you can see, it takes very
little stimulate us.

274
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:58,938
Yeah, but forget about that.

275
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,839
Are you ready?

276
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,941
Does a polar bear
poop in the snow?

277
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,810
I don't know,
I did not go to college.

278
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,213
All right I'm getting a
jilly bar for the winner.

279
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,781
And don't forget the whip.

280
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,350
That's right,
that's the attitude.

281
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,452
They might
be quaint and slightly odd

282
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,489
but they sure had a way
of enjoying themselves.

283
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh you want some?

284
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,392
They all
seemed skilled at making

285
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,661
the simplest occurrence
quite extraordinary.

286
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,796
I instantly regretted it.

287
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,634
And that is how it's done
here in Lake Mervielle.

288
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,302
We're all about manners.

289
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,003
We sure are.

290
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,999
She still ran but now she felt

291
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,370
the cold morning
mist wash over her.

292
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,571
And she didn't hate it.

293
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,179
So you understand
that this isn't a part

294
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,947
of the original instructions?

295
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,417
It's a cotta soul to
your father's will

296
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,219
to be acted upon giving
certain criteria.

297
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,690
What I'm about to tell you

298
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,925
will certainly be counter
to what you've heard

299
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,427
or known all these years.

300
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,463
But it's nonetheless the truth.

301
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,034
Don't you just love the count

302
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,037
even though he's a
pernicious rapscallion.

303
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,040
Like Rhett Butler
carrying Scarlett

304
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,141
up those fancy steps.

305
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,544
They don't make men
like that anymore.

306
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,214
You think all that
is progressive.

307
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,618
Well afternoon,
good townspeople.

308
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,552
I know what you're thinking-

309
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,921
who invited George
Clooney to this affair.

310
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,755
Oh I did.

311
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,326
Nice, no actually I'm just,

312
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,628
thought I'd swing by,
see if you got them mixers

313
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,462
I ordered?

314
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,996
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,665
I'm gonna mix that up.

316
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,566
I'll mix it right up for you.

317
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,601
I wish you would,
I wish you would.

318
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,737
So, what do you say, you in?

319
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,138
You in for some of
the best fishing

320
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,006
you'll ever see in
anywhere in these parts?

321
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,942
Oh,
I think I'll sit this one out.

322
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:16,776
Maybe next time.

323
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,244
Oh, what are you gonna do?

324
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,413
Go home and cry about your life?

325
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,514
So sad, boo!

326
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,183
You're no fun, she's fun.

327
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,952
No, I will not eat them.

328
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,165
Kind of reading the paper here.

329
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,300
What you reading about?

330
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,174
Boo.

331
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,546
Psst.

332
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,381
Do you have somewhere to be?

333
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,415
No.

334
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,284
Do you know I like
cheese raviolis?

335
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,852
Know what my mom always says?

336
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,955
Nope.

337
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,957
'Cause I like them a lot.

338
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,292
I...

339
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,126
Like a lot, a lot.

340
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,528
Right.

341
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,999
And she also wishes that
she was a spy, like you.

342
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,538
Hum, that looks interesting.

343
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,073
Well that's crazy
because I'm not a spy.

344
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,390
Do you have somewhere to be?

345
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,749
Nope, nope nowhere to be.

346
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,784
I could sit here
with you all day.

347
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,588
If you were stranded
in the rain forest

348
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,089
what's one item you'd have?

349
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,525
You stay here, I'm gonna go.

350
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,659
Okay.

351
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,693
Okay good.

352
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:46,733
She ain't coming back.

353
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,446
Hey good luck,
gotta have good luck

354
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,513
when you're fishing.

355
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,124
That's right 'cause I've
got questionable jujus

356
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,451
so we need all the
help we can get.

357
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,519
All right, let's roll.

358
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,721
Oh, I have to go to
the bathroom already.

359
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,072
I don't bite, you know.

360
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,647
Why thank you.

361
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,293
Hey.

362
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,928
Your skin's soft.

363
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,098
Okay, thank you.

364
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:09,949
Hey.

365
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,337
Hey, you okay?

366
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,642
Freddie?

367
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,810
Yeah, I'm just in it.

368
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,047
What?

369
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,081
Can't you feel it?

370
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,820
Memorizing it.

371
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,557
For next time.

372
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,225
Next time?

373
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,662
Like when I have to
go to the hospital.

374
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,196
Or get my blood drawn.

375
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,801
You're something else.

376
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,302
I know.

377
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,871
But I didn't ask to be.

378
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,473
Hey,
I didn't mean it like that.

379
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,542
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

380
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,045
Think I don't know
what people see?

381
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,682
Gawking at me.

382
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,585
Their eyes are like pin balls.

383
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,753
Look anywhere but at the dork,

384
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,321
that's what's in their minds.

385
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,192
But out of their mouths
were special needs.

386
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,929
One must be PC after all.

387
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,530
It's okay Max.

388
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,700
I have a really good life, I do.

389
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:39,538
And besides I get to know
things, feel things

390
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,041
other people can't.

391
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,446
Like how your heart
is so ginormous

392
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,382
and that's why it hurts so deep.

393
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,331
Listen,
try not to worry, okay?

394
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,433
His lifeline's here.

395
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,602
I can't get Rodney
on his cell phone.

396
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,037
He's a cowboy.

397
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,648
He's got about as much
use for a cell phone

398
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,606
as a damn donkey.

399
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,941
Don't defend him, Cat.

400
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,876
No, I'm not defending him.

401
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,144
I'm just stating a fact.

402
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,423
What's the story here?

403
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,759
- Huh?
- The story.

404
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,530
I mean he's smart as a
whip, this one.

405
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,533
Yeah but,

406
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,637
what is it?

407
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,175
It's called Fanconi Anemia.

408
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:54,346
It's rare as hell and
it clobbers the genes

409
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,749
that do DNA repair.

410
00:26:56,783 --> 00:27:00,987
Not to mention the
seizures and the cancer

411
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,355
just breathing down their necks.

412
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,457
If that's not enough
of a challenge

413
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:10,496
then life expectancy, tick tock.

414
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,067
His mother, Sammy,
she's a gladiator.

415
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,636
I've never seen her buckle.

416
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,938
I don't know how she does it.

417
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,710
I mean she's made out of
steel and strawberries.

418
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,118
Want you to join us
for dinner tonight.

419
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,619
Oh no, thank you.

420
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,654
Now you need to be with people.

421
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,858
Cat won't take no for an answer.

422
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:43,029
Well in that case.

423
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,367
Whoa whoa whoa you got one!

424
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,669
You got one, there we go!

425
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,906
Get it, get it, get it!

426
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,209
Let's take it off in there.

427
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,017
Hey we better get your home.

428
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,518
Okay, yeah.

429
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,257
That's why I didn't
eat the sandwich.

430
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,324
Yeah, yeah.

431
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,926
Mom, mom, mom!

432
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,527
What could you
possibly be thinking?

433
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,930
And who the hell do
you think you are?

434
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,198
Do you have a kid?

435
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,433
No because if you did you
would have never taken

436
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,169
my son without my permission.

437
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,003
Mom, she...

438
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,671
Sammy, Sammy,
let's reel it in.

439
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,882
Don't even, because I know
you went to the big lake.

440
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:27,706
Well of course we did.

441
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,041
There's no fish
in the small one.

442
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,543
Everyone knows no big
lake unless I'm along.

443
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,813
Did you remember to
take his afternoon meds?

444
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,349
What if he had a
seizure out there?

445
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,951
I brought them in my bag.

446
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,188
Oh see there you
go, no harm no foul.

447
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,690
- No harm no foul.
- Stay out of it.

448
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,768
Hey Freddie, here's you...

449
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,026
No.

450
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,260
Oh come on.

451
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,438
Sammy you can't take the fish
and his catch away from him.

452
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,630
That wouldn't be right.

453
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,465
Hey, I'm really sorry

454
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,968
but I would never hurt your son.

455
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:59,638
Mom,
Max is like crazy wonderful.

456
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,909
She's an awesome storyteller.

457
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,879
Imagine that.

458
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,247
Let's go make some dinner.

459
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,485
Yeah, this party's over.

460
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,755
So, I called Heather today.

461
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,591
But her phone was disconnected

462
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,527
so I did a little digging.

463
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,131
Ended up speaking to her mother.

464
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,900
Heather died about
five years ago.

465
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,602
My son always believes
the best in people

466
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,005
but I don't suffer
from that virtue.

467
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,441
Stay the hell away
from both of us.

468
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,677
You're right, and I'm sorry I
lied about Heather.

469
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,680
But the truth is I'm
working a special assignment

470
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,714
for the EPA.

471
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,186
We're investigating potential
environmental threats

472
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,154
in the area

473
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,689
and it's classified
so we work undercover.

474
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,025
I'm sorry for any confusion.

475
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,264
All right,
we'll see you later.

476
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,066
Officer of whatever that is.

477
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:07,006
Okay it's possible I was
a little too rough on her.

478
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,640
Oh come on, she's a good girl.

479
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,011
Trust me,
when have I ever led you astray?

480
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:12,879
Do not answer that.

481
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,947
Just go make my trout almandine,

482
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,482
the way I like it.

483
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,618
Well if you would
behave like a grown up.

484
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,786
I'm trying to, but...

485
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,787
I could.

486
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,500
I've got women coming
at me like bullets.

487
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,168
Did mom ever get here?

488
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,494
I have no idea.

489
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,029
This looks nice.

490
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,030
There you go.

491
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:31,998
Thank you.

492
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,299
She's joining us for dinner.

493
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,666
So sorry.

494
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,535
You should have
started without me.

495
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,642
That's against every
good breeding tip

496
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,012
you've ever crammed into
our little pagan ears.

497
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:46,845
Shut it!

498
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,180
This is our mom.

499
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,681
Mom, this is McKenzie Aaron.

500
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,682
Lovely to meet you.

501
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,584
How long have you been here?

502
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,020
A week.

503
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,187
Enjoying your stay?

504
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:57,156
Uh huh.

505
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,658
McKenzie's a
really great puzzler.

506
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,895
Oh so they've lured you
into their little conclave.

507
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,898
Hey, were you here
a few summers ago?

508
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:08,968
No.

509
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,370
You look familiar.

510
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,541
I'm just one of those
faces, I guess.

511
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
Yeah,
that's just so fascinating.

512
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,213
Why don't you tell us
what you're doing here.

513
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,249
Oh just getting
away from it all.

514
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,284
And yes, pointedly,
un fascinating.

515
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,555
Running,
that's where I've seen you.

516
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:33,692
Have you run by
the big lake yet?

517
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,262
Yeah, I've been hiking
and running everywhere.

518
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:39,198
It's some kind of
beautiful out there.

519
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,799
Some kind of beautiful.

520
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,637
Mom?

521
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:53,179
I understand you work
for the government?

522
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,984
Yeah,
mom used to be a congresswoman.

523
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,618
Now she's a consultant, though.

524
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:02,130
With the administration
you know,

525
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,090
the phone's ringing
off the hook.

526
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,125
Yeah, not an easy gig.

527
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,295
Yeah, that house of cards
selling his soul shit.

528
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,762
I thought we had a rule here.

529
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:15,434
Yeah, no iPhones or
politics at the dinner table.

530
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,503
We get enough of
it everywhere else.

531
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,846
It's because it's the
latest spectator sport.

532
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,108
Reality by stupid
America where we wait

533
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,942
everyday with sheer
anticipointment.

534
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,512
Aren't you clever, Sasha?

535
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,115
I seem to recall you
didn't show up to vote.

536
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,617
If people wanna know why
millennials have checked out

537
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,419
it's because you
made us check out.

538
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,855
With all your lies, BS,
spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

539
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,133
Tell us how you really feel.

540
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,191
Okay, here we go.

541
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,160
I think if the
millennials checked out

542
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,795
it's because we coddled
you so spectacularly.

543
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,031
Coddled?

544
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:48,000
Jesus, you were still drinking
back then for days at a time

545
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,536
and when I needed a
mother it wasn't you.

546
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,380
Stop screaming at her about
what she hasn't done right.

547
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,972
Look at you,
what have you done right?

548
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,017
This is bullshit.

549
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,609
McKenzie, I'm sorry McKenzie.

550
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,112
My girls are usually a
little more civilized.

551
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,146
What?

552
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,116
Enough!

553
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,351
Gabrielle, enough.

554
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,654
I forgot.

555
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,357
Gabrielle, come with me.

556
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,391
Gabrielle!

557
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,361
Don't sweetie.

558
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,065
I'm just gonna go help.

559
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,333
Oh my God.

560
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:55,867
McKenzie knew
from her years of FBI training

561
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,837
that there were far
deeper secrets buried here

562
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,139
than her own.

563
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,308
I'll be back.

564
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:02,334
See, isn't this nice?

565
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,370
You don't always have to
talk, you know.

566
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,477
You know what my
mom's favorite word is?

567
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,348
No, but I bet money
you're about to tell me.

568
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,418
Kintsukuroi.

569
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,752
Know what that means?

570
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,887
Not even remotely.

571
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,891
More beautiful for
having been broken.

572
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,695
It's Japanese.

573
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,207
Here.

574
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,342
It's cold.

575
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,553
I know you didn't see any
reason to meet your birth mother

576
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,123
and I assume that's in large
part because you were told

577
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
she left you.

578
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,562
But in fact that's
not what happened.

579
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,150
There's a couple ducks.

580
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,810
Does a one legged
duck swim in a circle?

581
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,646
Are you beating me?

582
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,249
Yes, I love when you babysit
me, Gabrielle.

583
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:26,452
Ah, feeling's
mutual, little man.

584
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,689
Freak!

585
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,661
Don't listen to them, okay?

586
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,195
They're jerks.

587
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,198
Hey,
what happened to you?

588
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,868
Yeah, stick your hand
in some meat grinders?

589
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,670
If you guys don't stop,

590
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,871
I'm gonna get mom.

591
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,114
Yeah, let's keep
playing, okay?

592
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,541
Hey lobster boy, get a little
too close to the lawn mower?

593
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,743
Oh look at you crying.

594
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,945
Boo hoo.

595
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,248
Creeper creeper why the freaker?

596
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm outta here.

597
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,951
Three.

598
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:00,919
What a retard.

599
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:01,853
I've never seen such a retard.

600
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,888
Mega tard.

601
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,325
Weirdo.

602
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:12,864
Hey!

603
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,533
What do you want?

604
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,934
What did you just say?

605
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,469
What do you care?

606
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:19,471
A hell of a lot is what I care.

607
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:21,139
Now listen up.

608
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,141
You speak to anyone
like that ever again,

609
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,310
I'm gonna find you.

610
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:27,379
I'll make your sorry little
lives freaking miserable.

611
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,814
You got that?

612
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:29,915
Fuck you!

613
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,286
I'm sorry, he told me to.

614
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,787
I really didn't mean it.

615
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,622
It was his fault.

616
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,656
You okay?

617
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,157
I didn't want to.

618
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,459
Then don't say it.

619
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:48,133
Are you okay?

620
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,469
Hey, that was cool
what you did over there.

621
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:54,105
Well, they won't be
bothering Freddie anymore.

622
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,441
No they certainly won't.

623
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,877
Honey were those the
same kids from last year?

624
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,514
Hey.

625
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,318
I know that it probably
doesn't feel like it

626
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,287
but it isn't you
they don't like.

627
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,389
It's themselves.

628
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:12,558
Okay?

629
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,197
What do you say we go get
you two those jilly bars?

630
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,165
Yeah?

631
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,199
Can Max come?

632
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,804
Uh, I'm sure she has
some things she has to do.

633
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,946
Thank you for that.

634
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,881
You think in this day and age

635
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,650
people would be a
little more sensitive.

636
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,186
I don't know how you
deal with the bullshit.

637
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,522
Well they certainly
don't hand out a manual.

638
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,325
I don't know,
you just learn to muddle through

639
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,061
and hope like hell that
people become less ignorant

640
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,597
and less angry.

641
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,333
Less fearful of those
who look different

642
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,503
or love different.

643
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:06,177
Freddie,
don't let them get to you, okay?

644
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,045
They just...

645
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,914
See the special
needs freak show.

646
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,181
Hey, don't say that!

647
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,117
Come on.

648
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,821
You know why I think they
call you special needs?

649
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,322
Because I'm all that?

650
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,926
No, it's not you who need us.

651
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,628
It's all of us who need you.

652
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,033
Okay, it's true.

653
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,036
Don't know what
I'd do without you.

654
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:42,213
Look, I promised them I'd
take them for jilly bars so...

655
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,875
Samantha!

656
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:09,928
In other news.

657
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,529
The Sister Wives just
took home a Grammy

658
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,699
for Song of the
Year, I Don't Play.

659
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,267
Lead singer Lisa Jane
remarked upon hearing the news

660
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,503
that she hoped women
everywhere find inspiration

661
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,871
in their journey.

662
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,212
Hey little man.

663
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,389
What's wrong?

664
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,661
Why don't you like Max?

665
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,965
I know what you need.

666
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,322
Hello?

667
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,292
Hi.

668
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,428
Hi.

669
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:06,297
Thanks for your
help the other day,

670
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,400
but you're just
here for a visit,

671
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,768
but Freddie's full time.

672
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,503
Not a roadside attraction.

673
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,340
So please, whatever you do

674
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,674
don't play him.

675
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,510
Hey, the last thing I'm
doing is playing your son.

676
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,746
Shit.

677
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,714
Look I shouldn't have said that.

678
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,585
He's pretty damn
insistent that I give you

679
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,619
a second chance.

680
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:35,961
He's got a heart that
will overlook anything.

681
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,829
And I just don't
wanna see him hurt.

682
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,698
So?

683
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,569
How about Saturday afternoon?

684
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:47,672
Sure.

685
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,019
So why puzzling?

686
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,325
I guess it's shown
me a whole new way

687
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,360
to see things.

688
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,631
It's taken me way
beyond what I thought

689
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,900
I could comprehend.

690
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:17,602
How so?

691
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:22,040
Well none of us
are remotely capable

692
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,176
of experiencing the
world we live in.

693
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,079
You know, we've created
two and three dimensional

694
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:30,581
boundaries just to try
to make sense of things.

695
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:34,552
But what lives inside the
spaces of those boundaries?

696
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,264
And you're able to see that

697
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,957
when you're puzzling?

698
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,329
Well I've had some
brief glimpses when I'm deep

699
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:49,500
into a puzzle and where
possibilities are limitless.

700
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:54,539
It's like looking at a cloud
and seeing the face of God.

701
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,875
Huh.

702
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,845
Well to puzzling.

703
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,779
Oh, to puzzling.

704
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,282
To going where no
man has gone before.

705
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:05,917
Oh yeah.

706
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,518
Live long and prosper.

707
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,015
Let me help.

708
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,316
You can't help.

709
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,351
Come on.

710
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:50,255
Come on, Vivienne,
what can I do?

711
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,365
Take me to the nearest bar.

712
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:04,702
Come on.

713
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,708
McKenzie, that's not her name?

714
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,720
Mom?

715
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:55,486
Hey!

716
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:58,956
Can I help?

717
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,427
No I just need to wait
for it to cool down.

718
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,462
Actually I'm pretty
handy with cars.

719
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,496
What's the problem?

720
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,835
Well it needs a
new, well everything.

721
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:13,604
It's just not a
priority on the list.

722
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:14,739
Next to all the bills

723
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,285
and I mean God how I thought
I could make a living

724
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,511
being a dance teacher
out here is beyond me.

725
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,814
Well you got a
lot on your plate.

726
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,050
Look, I'm not a martyr.

727
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,585
Oh, that's not what I heard.

728
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,855
I heard that you never crumble.

729
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,525
Oh trust me I have my days.

730
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,468
While we're waiting,

731
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:46,971
why don't you tell
me about them?

732
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,111
And then when he was five
and we had gone through

733
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:55,513
one of his surgeries,

734
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,648
one of my old dance
friends came by

735
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:00,117
and she proceeded to
tell me how everyone felt

736
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,820
so sorry that I didn't
have a normal child

737
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,156
and how it must
be such a burden.

738
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,124
Oh my God.

739
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:10,328
Yeah and then I asked
her why she thought

740
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,929
I wanted a normal kid

741
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,607
because I didn't want
Freddie to be anything

742
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,799
other than who he is.

743
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,801
And then she pulled me aside

744
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,503
and she said,
"Don't ever say that again.

745
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,137
Makes you sound crazy."

746
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:21,706
What?

747
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,940
Maybe I am crazy.

748
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,974
No, no.

749
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,878
Every day Freddie
teaches me something new.

750
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:32,650
I mean sure the every day
challenges can be annoying

751
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,989
but we really are just
very happy how we are.

752
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,661
I always say when you hug
Freddie it's like hugging God.

753
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,898
I mean how does it get
any better than that?

754
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:50,935
It doesn't.

755
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:57,675
It's her!

756
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,709
Quick, open the door!

757
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:01,078
Well she's not gonna
vanish into thin air.

758
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,082
Gosh, this is crazy
awesome that you're here.

759
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,355
Care for a surprise?

760
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:09,153
Does heaven taste
like cotton candy?

761
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,790
Mom's made the most awesome
cheese raviolis ever!

762
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,693
We're gonna have garlic bread

763
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,062
and for dessert some apple pie.

764
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,167
Look mom,
this is called the Nesting Doll

765
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,836
and it's like the
coolest thing ever.

766
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:30,875
It's like seeing all the
times of a person's life

767
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:36,314
and how things stay
part of you forever.

768
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,916
Max got her first
one from her mom

769
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,084
when she was four.

770
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:43,354
And always got a new one
at Christmas and birthdays.

771
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:46,424
And she has like
hundreds of them at home.

772
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:48,726
Hey, I'm not that old.

773
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,467
Okay, it's time for dinner
and early bedtime for you.

774
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:58,068
Can Max stay?

775
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,405
I don't know.

776
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,073
Can Max stay?

777
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:06,977
I'd love to.

778
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:10,848
Yeah!

779
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,702
Okay little man, time for bed.

780
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,002
It was only then that Max

781
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,338
began to fully grasp
their daily challenges.

782
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:53,017
Wow,
you weren't fooling around.

783
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,319
The monkeys.

784
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,855
Yeah, he collects them
like you do nesting dolls.

785
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,658
Why monkeys?

786
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,828
Well he used to love
how Curious George

787
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,263
was always busting out and
doing things he shouldn't

788
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,198
until that man with that...

789
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:10,835
Silly yellow hat.

790
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:14,204
I say don't mock me!

791
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:18,743
That's right.

792
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:23,213
I love you the
biggest, the mostest,

793
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,652
and the foreverest.

794
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,622
Mama, I love you the mostest.

795
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:20,965
Hi.

796
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,033
You had one, didn't you?

797
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,368
No, no.

798
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,336
Mom.

799
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,708
Okay, but I'm fine.

800
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,244
Look, more importantly,
how are you?

801
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,081
'Cause I know those kids
were back at the lake.

802
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,649
No mom.

803
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:39,850
Max took care of that.

804
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:43,954
You've been very
quiet all night long.

805
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:50,294
It's like when I have to go
to my place at the hospital

806
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,665
and you know I have to be there

807
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,867
until it's okay I can, right?

808
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:00,805
Yeah sweetie.

809
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,307
Is that where you've been?

810
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,848
Well McKenzie
does the same thing.

811
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,383
She has to go to
her place a lot.

812
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,453
A lot, a lot,

813
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,223
because she hurts crazy awful.

814
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:24,962
And she doesn't have someone
helping her feel safe.

815
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:03,200
I'll be right back.

816
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,009
Looks like someone's been busy.

817
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,153
I didn't wanna be rude, but...

818
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,745
Well you were the other night.

819
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:15,746
Left without saying goodbye.

820
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,182
Yeah I wasn't feeling
well, sorry.

821
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,850
Look, I'm not sure I buy that.

822
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,888
I'm not sure what
to think actually.

823
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,958
Freddie says you were just sad

824
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:32,062
and I will bet on Freddie
every single time.

825
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:42,172
To monkey man.

826
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:01,959
So if Freddie's right,

827
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,327
what are you so sad about?

828
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,330
I'm not sad, I'm just tired.

829
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,366
Okay look I'm not
trying to intrude.

830
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,635
I just wanted to say thank you.

831
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,669
Thank you?

832
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,908
Yeah,
for making my son so happy.

833
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,246
I don't think I have
ever seen him light up

834
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,014
the way he does
when you're around.

835
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,354
Well he's freakily awesome kid.

836
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,058
Maddening at times, but...

837
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,377
Whoo!

838
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,224
Hey,
I'm a pretty great listener.

839
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:13,530
I...

840
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,476
Thank you,
I've got something

841
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,968
for all you lovers out there.

842
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:18,869
I should be going.

843
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:19,703
I'll take you home.

844
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,006
No, no, no I've got a car.

845
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,982
What,
two for the price of one?

846
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,750
How'd I get so lucky?

847
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,886
Come on, let's go kick the
shit out of some dancing.

848
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,888
Ever seen this one dance?

849
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,423
Uh oh, you're in for a treat.

850
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,594
Hey Rodney,
we have to go change the keg.

851
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,164
Oh,
all right dance by yourself.

852
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,855
Hey, have you decided yet?

853
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:22,359
Look, you gotta order something.

854
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:25,862
Okay, you know what, a scotch.

855
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:26,696
Double.

856
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,298
You sure you wanna go that way?

857
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,035
All right.

858
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:21,451
Your mother didn't choose
to cut you out of her life.

859
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:23,954
That was your father's decision.

860
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:25,990
You father was a dear friend.

861
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:28,792
I watched him agonize
over this decision.

862
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,634
Thanks Mommo, I love it.

863
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,304
Oh my baby bobo.

864
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,506
You're getting so big.

865
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,108
Not big enough.

866
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,343
I can't wait to grow up
and become a policeman

867
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,611
just like daddy.

868
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,981
You don't want to grow up too
fast, sweetie.

869
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:53,317
Once you've done it,
there's no going back.

870
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,477
So do you have to work tomorrow?

871
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,112
How are those kids?

872
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:23,380
Kids are big.

873
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:33,723
Samantha!

874
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:42,199
Hey, Samantha, Samantha!

875
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,534
Do you always cut out on people

876
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:46,303
without any explanation?

877
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,971
No, of course not.

878
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,639
Really McKenzie?

879
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,075
I don't know what to think.

880
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:54,578
Something about you
is just not right.

881
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,512
Something is off.

882
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:56,913
I don't know...

883
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:57,747
My mother died.

884
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:58,648
What?

885
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,350
Last night, a year ago.

886
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,219
And I just, I lost it.

887
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:05,989
And no,
I'm not one to cut out on people

888
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,024
so I want to apologize.

889
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,631
Come with me.

890
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,712
My gun was in my
pocket the whole time.

891
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:31,924
I don't know how
you put up with it.

892
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:33,717
Yeah, I don't know.

893
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:48,698
This isn't what I do.

894
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:51,735
What you do to
forget or in general?

895
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,005
Both.

896
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:58,975
Beckett, it's me.

897
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:02,579
Listen I need you to
do something for me.

898
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,152
So tell me about her.

899
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:49,058
She was, she was the
only person I ever trusted.

900
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:51,328
In everything.

901
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,674
You know I used to
get teased a lot

902
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:58,502
about being adopted but I
couldn't have been loved more

903
01:08:58,535 --> 01:08:59,869
by anyone else.

904
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,140
She was...

905
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,018
My dad used to bring me up here.

906
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,290
So if I ever need
to clear my head,

907
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,725
this is where I come.

908
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,829
You've never mentioned him.

909
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:26,896
Does he live here?

910
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:32,202
He died when I was 23

911
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:35,639
so I know what it's
like to lose a parent

912
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:36,673
that shaped you.

913
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,309
It's still so fresh for you.

914
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:40,344
Yeah.

915
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:42,879
I am sorry about your dad.

916
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,883
Don't be, he was amazing.

917
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:51,888
But when he passed I
sort of bottomed out.

918
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:55,191
I stopped dancing.

919
01:09:55,225 --> 01:10:00,196
Ended up with Derek and
got pregnant within months.

920
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,668
Something was wrong
with the pregnancy.

921
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,969
We just didn't know what.

922
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,905
But the moment that he was born

923
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,975
everyone pushed for a DNR,

924
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:17,514
so they administered
the morphine

925
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,882
and took him off the vent.

926
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,454
And when they put
him on my chest

927
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,292
my heart broke in
two million pieces.

928
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:33,196
He was so fragile.

929
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,099
If there's a hell on this earth

930
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,502
it's trying to
help your baby die.

931
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:47,711
I just held him and I prayed

932
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,679
and I told him it
was okay to go.

933
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:52,949
Whatever he needed.

934
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,952
Derek, he left the hospital.

935
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,287
Said he couldn't be there.

936
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:02,426
Where are you?

937
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:04,461
And I felt like I was
in a horror movie.

938
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,200
It's so surreal just waiting
and waiting for him to pass.

939
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,174
I need you,
I can't do this alone.

940
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:22,045
But he just kept
breathing and living.

941
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:29,786
Derek, the doctors,
my friends, everyone

942
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,457
they'd already given up on him.

943
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:35,425
What are you saying?

944
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:39,028
It's too hard for
you to watch him die?

945
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:42,366
I spent 135 days in the NICU.

946
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,670
We will never ever
come back from this.

947
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:49,172
I'm done.

948
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,945
135 days of strong babies dying

949
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,481
and weak babies living.

950
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:01,985
And it was all so arbitrary.

951
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,091
You know it made me realize

952
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:12,962
motherhood is not
an entitlement.

953
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,499
It's a sacred privilege.

954
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:18,101
So you damn well better
bring it and don't complain.

955
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:23,306
My God, I'm sorry.

956
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,842
We came up here to help you

957
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,844
and off I go on this rant.

958
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:28,945
Are you kidding me?

959
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,349
Thank you, thank you for sharing
that with me.

960
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,586
You don't have to be sad anymore

961
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:12,722
because you have us now.

962
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,391
We are merged.

963
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:19,563
Is he okay?

964
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:21,665
What is merged?

965
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,470
He merges the people
he loves into his soul.

966
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:30,006
Very few get that honor.

967
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:33,577
I am honored.

968
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,114
Please excuse my ignorance,

969
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:42,886
but when does he
need the wheelchair?

970
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,089
Well when he's completely
well he doesn't need it at all,

971
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,426
but when he's really sick
we use it to conserve

972
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,461
his energy.

973
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:01,605
So does he have any
contact with his dad?

974
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:03,873
None.

975
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,710
Anyone else since?

976
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,948
It's one thing to
date a single mom.

977
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,019
Quite another when you add
a wheelchair to the mix.

978
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,621
How's that?

979
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,789
Well imagine every
night you come home,

980
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:22,592
the first thing we talk
about is Freddie's day.

981
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:26,329
Doctors visits,
test results, therapy.

982
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:29,633
Or maybe you finally
fit in that tennis game

983
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:34,470
and I'm blowing up your
phone all day with texts

984
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,505
from the ER.

985
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,809
Forget anyone else's
needs getting met

986
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:43,813
because my priority is the
Freddie channel 24 seven.

987
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:48,251
Don't I sound like
a perfect catch?

988
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:52,756
I don't play tennis.

989
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:10,239
Not that fast.

990
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:12,208
I thought I'd get him home.

991
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,242
Oh sure, sure.

992
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:23,519
Hey, would you like
to join us for dinner?

993
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:28,491
Yeah, yeah.

994
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,669
I just have to drop by my cabin,

995
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:31,027
but then I'll be there.

996
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,061
Say seven?

997
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,197
Yeah.

998
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:48,444
Hey Beckett,
were you able to match it?

999
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,280
Oh good, yes yes,
send it to me right away.

1000
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:06,329
Oh fuck.

1001
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,871
How can I help you?

1002
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,374
What is your best bottle of red?

1003
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,276
You don't wanna know.

1004
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,746
But I happen to have some
of my private reserve

1005
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:27,083
for folks with
discriminating tastes.

1006
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,117
Be right back.

1007
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,230
Of all the gin joints.

1008
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,265
Vivienne.

1009
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,533
It's kind of a shocker huh?

1010
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:53,276
Buck, can I get two
shots of your best scotch?

1011
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:54,778
Oh no, I don't want...

1012
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,680
No, no, it's okay Buck, yeah.

1013
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,485
Pretty remarkable
coincidence if you ask me.

1014
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:06,589
My mother used to
bring me here as a kid so

1015
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,291
coincidence dispelled.

1016
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,959
I know who you are McKenzie.

1017
01:17:10,894 --> 01:17:13,763
Okay, who am I?

1018
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:16,065
You're a Quantico rock star.

1019
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,504
Although you're off at present
for disciplinary action.

1020
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,907
And I'm sorry about your mother.

1021
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,843
But I have to ask
myself why is it

1022
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:29,879
that we are both vacationing
in this little town

1023
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:31,881
that I've made my second home?

1024
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:33,783
So who are you working for?

1025
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,184
And what is it that you want?

1026
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,887
You saw for
yourself I'm on leave.

1027
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:41,624
And what happened 10 years ago
is nobody's business, okay?

1028
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,459
So if you'll excuse me,

1029
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,636
- I'm running late.
- I want you to stay away

1030
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,029
from my family.

1031
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:48,631
I still have some sway
with your director

1032
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,067
and I can make things very
uncomfortable for you.

1033
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:55,038
I'll do whatever
the hell I please.

1034
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,853
His little hair is sticking up.

1035
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,455
It's killing me.

1036
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,696
Jesus, he's burning up.

1037
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:27,570
I was afraid he was
coming down with something.

1038
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,139
I'm gonna go get some Tylenol.

1039
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,290
Seriously, fucking ridiculous.

1040
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,907
Oh no I've got him.

1041
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:11,680
Let's go.

1042
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:38,041
Do you need to take him in?

1043
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,979
Unfortunately his
immune system is shot.

1044
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,447
Every time he goes
in the hospital

1045
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,115
he catches something even worse.

1046
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,586
And I've had plenty of
practice breaking these fevers.

1047
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,788
Look I'm sure you
have other things

1048
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:53,823
you need to get to.

1049
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:55,825
Not a chance.

1050
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,663
Mom, mom!

1051
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:03,799
Where's... what are you doing?

1052
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:05,835
Get over here quick
and shut the door.

1053
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,841
FBI?

1054
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:13,776
Forget that.

1055
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:14,777
How do they know each other

1056
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,445
and what the fuck
is she doing here?

1057
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,781
They probably just know
each other through work.

1058
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,159
Mom was on the
intelligence committee.

1059
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:21,885
Couldn't they have
just met there?

1060
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,532
Gabrielle, look at this photo.

1061
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,792
And try not to be a
fucking Disney princess.

1062
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,327
What do you see?

1063
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,662
It's like she just
can't help herself.

1064
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:35,498
Wonder what else
she hasn't told us?

1065
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,111
These are the nights
that I'm haunted.

1066
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,848
I can't stand to think
of him suffering and...

1067
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:55,351
Hey hey, he wants to be here.

1068
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,786
He's made that very clear.

1069
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,390
What can I do, what do you need?

1070
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:04,860
Get me out of my head.

1071
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:08,831
Tell me more about your mother,

1072
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,233
the way that you do Freddie.

1073
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,841
Okay, we would go on
these star ventures.

1074
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,842
Star ventures?

1075
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,843
Yeah.

1076
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,347
We would get up in the
morning with the stars

1077
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,949
and I'd get in the car

1078
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:27,883
and then go on an adventure.

1079
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:30,954
No rules, no shoulds,

1080
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:35,558
and we would have the best
time you could ever imagine.

1081
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,964
When I was like six or seven

1082
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:42,498
she started this tradition

1083
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,569
where we would go
around the table

1084
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,473
and mama would ask
what was the best thing

1085
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,541
that happened to you today.

1086
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,244
And the worst.

1087
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:59,182
Or if this was your
last day on earth

1088
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:01,317
what would you do.

1089
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,820
And she would wrap it up with,

1090
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,691
what did you learn
about yourself today.

1091
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:15,598
So, what did you learn
about yourself today?

1092
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:20,469
That my greatest mom on earth

1093
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:22,471
may have to share her title.

1094
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:34,883
I think his fever's
finally breaking.

1095
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,662
You belong to us.

1096
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,465
I'm here.

1097
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:52,968
I'm not going anywhere.

1098
01:22:53,002 --> 01:22:54,070
Love you, monkey man.

1099
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,847
Wait a
minute, what's this?

1100
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:11,320
You know what, maybe we found
enough dirt on her

1101
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:12,155
for one day.

1102
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:13,689
Do we really wanna...

1103
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:14,657
Don't buckle now.

1104
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:15,691
Open it.

1105
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,514
How do you do it?

1106
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:42,185
Keeping him well,
the constant stress.

1107
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:46,122
Dancing.

1108
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:49,125
Wait, isn't that the
definition of irony?

1109
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:55,198
How absolute freedom
of movement saves me

1110
01:23:55,231 --> 01:23:58,701
from the way that he's
trapped inside his body.

1111
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:02,305
If I didn't have
dance, I don't...

1112
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,709
You could...

1113
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:10,779
The couch is comfortable,
it's so late.

1114
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:13,316
Oh no, I'm fine thank you.

1115
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:17,320
And thank you for
sharing your son with me.

1116
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,389
Yeah.

1117
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,059
Hey, are you okay?

1118
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,930
I don't know why I'm crying.

1119
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,441
No, it's been a hell
of a stressful day.

1120
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:31,134
No, it's not that.

1121
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:38,507
It's just, well no one
has ever been like you are

1122
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:40,743
with Freddie, and...

1123
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:07,303
It's okay.

1124
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:37,533
Oh my God, I don't know why,

1125
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:38,967
I just was...

1126
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:45,508
Oh my God.

1127
01:30:46,509 --> 01:30:47,843
It goes so long.

1128
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:50,846
I thought forget the
passion ever existed.

1129
01:31:11,534 --> 01:31:13,636
Did you and mom
have a sleepover?

1130
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,972
- Uh hi.
- Hi!

1131
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:18,741
We did,
like you and Kyle do sometimes.

1132
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:21,009
How about some orange juice

1133
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:22,477
and I'll make my
special pancakes?

1134
01:31:22,511 --> 01:31:23,979
Can we have another one tonight

1135
01:31:24,012 --> 01:31:25,981
and we can all watch a movie?

1136
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:29,117
You know what,
I would love that

1137
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:31,186
but right now I've gotta run.

1138
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:32,020
Bye.

1139
01:31:32,054 --> 01:31:33,055
Oh bye.

1140
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:40,328
So what's the deal with Rodney?

1141
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:42,230
Are you jealous?

1142
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,335
He's my uncle, my dad's brother.

1143
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:48,479
That's how we ended up here.

1144
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,872
Are you kidding me?

1145
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:50,906
Oh my!

1146
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,142
Okay, okay.

1147
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:55,578
Better?

1148
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:56,612
Yeah, yeah.

1149
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,348
Hey,
I need to tell you something.

1150
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:05,453
Yeah?

1151
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,426
Oh my God, we're gonna be late.

1152
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,696
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

1153
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:16,198
You know what,
never mind, it can wait.

1154
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:17,032
You sure?

1155
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:18,066
Yeah.

1156
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:23,105
Have you ever tried
these little pig navels?

1157
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:25,440
They're really good.

1158
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:27,175
I wanna try one.

1159
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:31,513
Hi everyone, sorry we're late.

1160
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,447
Better late than never.

1161
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,782
Never late's better.

1162
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:35,851
Max, these are the Pinchot's.

1163
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,120
Yeah, we've all met.

1164
01:32:38,153 --> 01:32:39,087
Apparently?

1165
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:41,256
Yeah, we're all practically
family now.

1166
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:42,257
Oh that's right.

1167
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,292
Your cabins are only a
few down from Colin's.

1168
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:46,528
Yeah, maybe you should go.

1169
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,772
This looks like a family thing.

1170
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:49,197
Max, Max.

1171
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:50,232
Max!

1172
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,234
Don't be shy now.

1173
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,203
Max, come have a seat.

1174
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:56,805
I need you here with me.

1175
01:32:59,642 --> 01:33:01,043
I'd like to make a toast.

1176
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,077
Oh yes.

1177
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:06,081
To my beautiful daughter.

1178
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:10,285
My loving, lovable,
tightly wound,

1179
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:11,654
complex daughter.

1180
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:13,822
You're not as young
as you used to be.

1181
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:16,258
But you're not as old
as you're gonna be.

1182
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,827
Happy birthday, we love you!

1183
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:21,163
Happy birthday.

1184
01:33:21,196 --> 01:33:22,631
Thanks dad.

1185
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:24,099
Happy birthday.

1186
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,803
That was terrible.

1187
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:28,837
Oh thanks.

1188
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,342
So,
how do you all know each other?

1189
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:37,312
Max goes fishing with us

1190
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:39,581
and she's pretty good at
chess, too.

1191
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:44,452
And she tells crazy
awesome stories.

1192
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,455
That is fascinating.

1193
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,293
You just make friends
all over the place.

1194
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:53,628
Max is more than just a
friend, Miss Vivienne.

1195
01:33:53,662 --> 01:33:56,198
Max and mom are like
Rodney and Cass.

1196
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:58,901
You know,
friends with benedicts.

1197
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:01,003
Okay.

1198
01:34:01,036 --> 01:34:02,037
I beg your pardon?

1199
01:34:04,006 --> 01:34:05,007
That's not exact.

1200
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,009
Make me feel pretty.

1201
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:09,611
Well, cat's out of the bag.

1202
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,279
Well who can blame me.

1203
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:12,647
Here's to the young couple.

1204
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:14,349
I'm getting in on that.

1205
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:20,388
And when Max stays over tonight

1206
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:24,693
we're all gonna watch a
movie, right mom?

1207
01:34:24,727 --> 01:34:25,794
Yes.

1208
01:34:25,828 --> 01:34:28,130
Well happy fricking
birthday mom.

1209
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,698
I am not gonna let this happen.

1210
01:34:29,732 --> 01:34:33,368
I suggest that you
leave, Agent DeRitter.

1211
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,803
Agent what?

1212
01:34:34,837 --> 01:34:35,637
What are you talking about?

1213
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,405
Your friend here, she's FBI.

1214
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:38,741
She's been here spying on me

1215
01:34:38,774 --> 01:34:40,342
because of the
upcoming hearings.

1216
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:42,477
I've read her file,
she's dangerous.

1217
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,912
That's what she's doing.

1218
01:34:43,946 --> 01:34:45,413
That's not, that's not...

1219
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:46,414
Vivienne, calm down.

1220
01:34:46,448 --> 01:34:47,916
I'm not gonna calm down.

1221
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:49,251
She's been suspended.

1222
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:50,652
She uses people.

1223
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:51,586
Sam?

1224
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:52,420
Mom?

1225
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:53,255
She's always on the make.

1226
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:54,189
You have to leave now!

1227
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:55,991
- Mom!
- Vivienne!

1228
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:58,126
Calm down now.

1229
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,064
Mom, it's starting.

1230
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:06,334
I'm right here with
you, you're safe.

1231
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:07,369
Get me my bag.

1232
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,873
I'm right here baby.

1233
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,708
Freddie?

1234
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:19,714
Okay.

1235
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,990
Okay, okay, breathe
in, breathe in.

1236
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:35,798
It's okay baby.

1237
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:36,832
Max.

1238
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:38,967
Hey monkey man.

1239
01:35:39,001 --> 01:35:40,135
Max.

1240
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:41,103
Hey monkey man.

1241
01:35:41,136 --> 01:35:42,470
I need to get him home.

1242
01:35:42,504 --> 01:35:46,909
Okay yeah,
let's get him out of here.

1243
01:35:46,942 --> 01:35:49,111
Let's get him out of here.

1244
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:50,779
Leave him alone.

1245
01:35:50,813 --> 01:35:52,480
I'm going to get going as well.

1246
01:35:54,349 --> 01:35:55,626
You couldn't just
leave, could you?

1247
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:56,684
I told you!

1248
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:01,456
Hey, hey, hey,

1249
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:02,733
please just call me and
let me know how he is.

1250
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:03,758
Move!

1251
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:05,493
Sam!

1252
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,471
I knew this was gonna happen.

1253
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,664
She just couldn't listen.

1254
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:11,033
Who are you?

1255
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:13,277
And all this time I
was protecting you

1256
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:15,270
thinking Sasha was
too hard on you.

1257
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:17,739
I don't have time for
whatever Sasha has fed you.

1258
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,808
The truth, the truth, mom!

1259
01:36:19,842 --> 01:36:21,609
Before we become judge and jury

1260
01:36:21,643 --> 01:36:23,912
maybe you ought to listen
to some facts here.

1261
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:25,080
Or more tedious excuses.

1262
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,414
Okay, both of you,

1263
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:27,782
enough, sit down.

1264
01:36:29,684 --> 01:36:31,453
Go on Viv,
I'll take care of this.

1265
01:36:31,486 --> 01:36:32,487
Go on.

1266
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:22,570
Your mother didn't choose
to cut you out of her life.

1267
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:24,206
That was your father's decision.

1268
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,908
He gave your mother
chance after chance

1269
01:37:25,941 --> 01:37:28,610
but she just couldn't
pull it together.

1270
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:30,845
And then when you were two,

1271
01:37:30,879 --> 01:37:32,915
she passed out while
you were in her care.

1272
01:37:32,948 --> 01:37:35,617
She quite literally lost you.

1273
01:37:40,555 --> 01:37:41,856
And then a neighbor spotted you

1274
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,525
wandering down a busy street.

1275
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:47,095
That was the last your
mother ever saw of you.

1276
01:37:47,129 --> 01:37:49,007
So why are you
telling me all this now?

1277
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:51,366
'Cause of this counsel
to your father's will.

1278
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:54,937
I was directed to share
this information with you

1279
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:59,341
when you turned 25 or
when you got pregnant.

1280
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:02,444
He wanted you to
meet your mother.

1281
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:21,796
I don't understand.

1282
01:38:29,837 --> 01:38:33,908
So does that make
her our sister?

1283
01:38:33,942 --> 01:38:35,077
Half sister.

1284
01:38:37,812 --> 01:38:39,081
And Freddie's our nephew.

1285
01:38:40,182 --> 01:38:41,783
Forgive me for staring.

1286
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:48,456
I'm just trying to take you in.

1287
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,026
That makes two of us.

1288
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,428
Samantha, it's McKenzie.

1289
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:54,496
Can you just call me?

1290
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,401
It's me again, I'm sorry.

1291
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:00,935
Can you please just call me.

1292
01:39:00,969 --> 01:39:02,337
I'm going crazy.

1293
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:05,673
Your mother tried to
do everything she could

1294
01:39:05,707 --> 01:39:09,544
to mend fences during
Samantha's pregnancy.

1295
01:39:10,478 --> 01:39:13,315
They even began to forge a
really nice relationship.

1296
01:39:14,382 --> 01:39:15,717
What happened?

1297
01:39:16,551 --> 01:39:19,687
Well things blew apart
when Freddie was born.

1298
01:39:19,721 --> 01:39:23,425
I need you,
I can't do this alone.

1299
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,160
I want to honey.

1300
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:27,329
I'm just not strong
like you are.

1301
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:32,734
We will never,
ever come back from this.

1302
01:39:35,337 --> 01:39:36,338
I'm done.

1303
01:39:37,072 --> 01:39:38,540
Take me to the nearest bar.

1304
01:39:42,877 --> 01:39:45,547
Well she didn't hear from
Samantha for seven years.

1305
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:51,653
As Freddie grew older he began
to ask if he had any family.

1306
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,689
Is that why we
feel so close to him?

1307
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:55,723
Maybe.

1308
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:59,161
Or maybe you just can't
help but feel close to him.

1309
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,802
Why mom,
why didn't you tell us?

1310
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,738
This really was up to
Samantha to share with you.

1311
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:14,542
After all she didn't have
to make contact with me.

1312
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:17,145
Whatever.

1313
01:40:17,179 --> 01:40:20,014
Sasha, I know that you
wanna be angry with me

1314
01:40:20,048 --> 01:40:21,616
to cover up your hurt.

1315
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:27,255
And yes, I have made such
a mess of so many things.

1316
01:40:27,289 --> 01:40:30,425
I am trying, I really am.

1317
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,994
And I can't even ask
you to meet me halfway

1318
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,764
because I know that I have
to earn your trust back again

1319
01:40:36,798 --> 01:40:37,899
over time,

1320
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:43,004
but right now I need to
go and make sure that

1321
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,407
Freddie and Samantha are okay.

1322
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:53,515
Samantha, please just let
me know that Freddie's okay.

1323
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:56,618
I know you're upset,
but I can explain.

1324
01:40:57,652 --> 01:40:59,197
And there's something
I need to tell you.

1325
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:01,723
But I can't do this
over the phone.

1326
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,424
Can you watch him?

1327
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,425
What?

1328
01:41:37,459 --> 01:41:39,294
I need to run to the
pharmacy to pick up

1329
01:41:39,327 --> 01:41:40,328
his seizure medication.

1330
01:41:40,362 --> 01:41:41,796
Oh sure.

1331
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:43,365
Okay, I'll be right back.

1332
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:49,804
Miss Vivienne?

1333
01:41:50,538 --> 01:41:51,539
Yes honey?

1334
01:41:52,274 --> 01:41:54,909
You and I have a lot in common.

1335
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:55,943
How's that honey?

1336
01:41:57,712 --> 01:41:59,314
We only get one day at a time.

1337
01:42:01,816 --> 01:42:06,053
So we've gotta make
each one count.

1338
01:42:14,196 --> 01:42:15,639
Your mother must have
forgotten her keys.

1339
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:16,898
I'll be right back, okay?

1340
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:30,312
What are you doing here?

1341
01:42:30,345 --> 01:42:32,614
I thought I made
myself perfectly clear.

1342
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:33,687
What are you doing here?

1343
01:42:33,715 --> 01:42:35,283
I am here to help my daughter

1344
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:38,152
and so help me God,
you stay away from her.

1345
01:42:39,821 --> 01:42:41,155
What?

1346
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:42,790
What are you talking about?

1347
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:44,192
My daughter, Samantha.

1348
01:42:44,226 --> 01:42:46,828
I have just gotten
her back into my life

1349
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:48,306
and the last thing I
am gonna let you do

1350
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,831
is hurt her.

1351
01:42:49,864 --> 01:42:52,500
No, no, no way.

1352
01:42:52,534 --> 01:42:55,703
I am just building a
relationship with her

1353
01:42:55,737 --> 01:42:58,406
and it would be destroyed
if she finds out.

1354
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,307
She has to know, Vivienne.

1355
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:00,174
I'm not gonna lie to her now.

1356
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,244
What the hell is going on here?

1357
01:43:02,277 --> 01:43:03,311
It's nothing.

1358
01:43:03,345 --> 01:43:05,480
We knew each other
from years ago.

1359
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,982
No, someone is gonna
tell me what's going on.

1360
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,251
It shouldn't have happened.

1361
01:43:09,284 --> 01:43:10,352
McKenzie?

1362
01:43:10,385 --> 01:43:11,586
I was drunk honey.

1363
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:13,355
No, that's enough mom!

1364
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:19,627
McKenzie?

1365
01:43:21,963 --> 01:43:22,964
We were lovers.

1366
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,477
I want you both out.

1367
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:38,112
- Sam.
- Now.

1368
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:39,381
I said now!

1369
01:43:42,984 --> 01:43:46,187
Sam, I am so sorry,

1370
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,589
but I can't take this back.

1371
01:43:47,622 --> 01:43:49,924
It was 10 years ago.

1372
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:52,026
Why her of all people?

1373
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,027
Why didn't you say something?

1374
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,296
It only lasted a week

1375
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:57,465
and how could I know
that she was your mother?

1376
01:43:57,499 --> 01:43:59,434
I was in D.C.
for the Fallen Heroes Memorial

1377
01:43:59,467 --> 01:44:03,305
and we were both wasted
and in so much pain.

1378
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:04,238
Spare me, spare me.

1379
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:06,474
I know pain,
that's what this life is.

1380
01:44:06,508 --> 01:44:08,109
It's filled with pain.

1381
01:44:08,142 --> 01:44:09,477
It doesn't play fair.

1382
01:44:09,511 --> 01:44:10,445
It kicks you in the gut

1383
01:44:10,478 --> 01:44:12,980
but you don't have the
luxury of self pity

1384
01:44:13,014 --> 01:44:14,416
or to go out and get wasted

1385
01:44:14,449 --> 01:44:17,251
because you have a sick
child to take care of.

1386
01:44:17,285 --> 01:44:18,486
And every minute has to count

1387
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,755
because it can all go
away in a heartbeat.

1388
01:44:20,788 --> 01:44:22,457
Hey, look at me.

1389
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:23,958
Look at me, please.

1390
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,960
You don't have to be a
rock every single day

1391
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:29,096
and you don't have
to do this alone.

1392
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,365
Okay, you don't.

1393
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,278
I don't know who I'm more in
love with, you or your son.

1394
01:44:34,302 --> 01:44:35,970
But I swear to you.

1395
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:37,339
What?

1396
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:38,773
Swear to me what?

1397
01:44:38,806 --> 01:44:39,607
That I'm in this!

1398
01:44:39,641 --> 01:44:40,642
I'm in.

1399
01:44:41,376 --> 01:44:42,477
A thousand percent.

1400
01:44:43,445 --> 01:44:46,213
Today, maybe tomorrow.

1401
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:51,252
You have no idea what it's like

1402
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:53,388
to play with an expiration date.

1403
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:01,496
Watching,
watching the days go by

1404
01:45:06,868 --> 01:45:11,305
and the more days you
get, all expired.

1405
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:16,043
And you will simply
expire along with it.

1406
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,784
Stop now!

1407
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:24,318
We can't afford the time

1408
01:45:24,352 --> 01:45:26,087
to see if you're
telling the truth.

1409
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,056
Especially with
your track record.

1410
01:45:30,558 --> 01:45:31,559
So leave.

1411
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:34,729
Please leave.

1412
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:15,202
It was a year later

1413
01:46:15,236 --> 01:46:17,038
when McKenzie got the call.

1414
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:26,981
Vivienne?

1415
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:30,485
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.

1416
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:35,766
I guess things didn't
turn out the way

1417
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:37,291
either one of us wanted.

1418
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:39,894
So why am I here?

1419
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:45,700
Because I needed
to see your face

1420
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:49,136
when I tell you how
deeply sorry I am

1421
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,805
for all the trouble I caused.

1422
01:46:52,273 --> 01:46:53,941
I just got my year's chip.

1423
01:46:53,975 --> 01:46:55,643
Hopefully this
time it will take.

1424
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:58,412
Good for you.

1425
01:46:59,514 --> 01:47:02,083
I moved us all permanently
up to Lake Mervielle.

1426
01:47:02,116 --> 01:47:04,686
So that we could be near
Samantha and Freddie.

1427
01:47:06,287 --> 01:47:07,321
That little boy.

1428
01:47:09,857 --> 01:47:12,093
If we all had one tenth
the courage he has.

1429
01:47:16,531 --> 01:47:18,299
Sounds like one
big happy family.

1430
01:47:30,712 --> 01:47:32,146
They need you McKenzie.

1431
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:57,672
Dear Max,

1432
01:47:57,705 --> 01:48:00,842
gosh I've missed
you crazy awful.

1433
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:01,876
So does mom.

1434
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:04,946
She may not say it out loud

1435
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,180
but like I told you,

1436
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:08,883
I can feel things.

1437
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:13,454
I know things got a little
messed up last fall.

1438
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,823
And everyone made mistakes.

1439
01:48:15,857 --> 01:48:19,493
But I kind of think mistakes
are like birthday candles.

1440
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:21,128
The more you have to blow out

1441
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:22,997
just means the
wiser you've become.

1442
01:48:27,368 --> 01:48:30,037
Kind of like my mom's favorite
word, Kintsukuroi.

1443
01:48:31,673 --> 01:48:33,608
We all got a little
broken last year.

1444
01:48:34,776 --> 01:48:38,179
But from the broken we
can become beautiful.

1445
01:48:42,617 --> 01:48:44,094
My mom says she's
sorry she can't be here,

1446
01:48:44,118 --> 01:48:45,286
but have a great trip.

1447
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:48,723
And you can't go without
some full moon pie.

1448
01:48:54,295 --> 01:48:55,997
Hey, send postcards.

1449
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,465
Oh yes and text from everywhere.

1450
01:49:11,312 --> 01:49:12,313
Max!

1451
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:16,784
You ready for your
first star venture?

1452
01:49:16,818 --> 01:49:19,120
Does a pole beat jilly bar?

1453
01:49:19,153 --> 01:49:21,188
I don't know.

1454
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:24,191
Star venture numero uno!

1455
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:35,269
12 incredible years passed.

1456
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:38,940
And I watched their love grow
stronger and more intimate

1457
01:49:38,973 --> 01:49:39,974
each day.

1458
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:43,577
Not that there weren't
challenging times

1459
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:46,580
but they weathered them
with grace and dignity.

1460
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:50,584
In between the illnesses
we all made sure

1461
01:49:50,618 --> 01:49:54,221
we lived each day like
it might be our last.

1462
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:58,292
Max now fully understood that
making the simplest things

1463
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:01,162
become special,
was the secret to being

1464
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:02,797
inside of life.

1465
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:05,299
Not just a bystander.

1466
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:06,533
I love you monkey man.

1467
01:50:07,368 --> 01:50:11,038
I loved her
with everything in me.

1468
01:50:12,306 --> 01:50:15,810
We had a plan to convince
mom to have another child.

1469
01:50:17,478 --> 01:50:19,213
Because I knew she
would want that.

1470
01:50:21,048 --> 01:50:22,817
Because I know things.

1471
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:29,657
If you could tell
me that I could stay

1472
01:50:29,691 --> 01:50:31,558
a nesting doll forever,

1473
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:36,163
bundled in my shell of
handmade fairytale flesh,

1474
01:50:37,865 --> 01:50:39,133
I might consider staying.

1475
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,309
But I have grown very tired.

1476
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,215
I am full of peace.

1477
01:50:56,884 --> 01:50:58,686
And it's their time now.
